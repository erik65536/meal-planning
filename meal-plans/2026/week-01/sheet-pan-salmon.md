# Sheet Pan Salmon with Vegetables

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 1 large skin-on salmon fillet

### Vegetables

- 1-1.5 lb russet potatoes, diced (0.5 inch cubes)
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 8 oz green beans, trimmed

### Bold Low-Sodium Seasoning

- 2 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 0.5 tsp black pepper
- 0.5 tsp lemon zest (or dried lemon peel)
- Fresh lemon wedges for serving

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut potatoes into small, even cubes so they cook at the same rate as other ingredients.
- Pat salmon dry before seasoning for better browning.
- Leave skin on salmon—it crisps up nicely and helps hold the fish together.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Convection Oven to 400°F.

2.  **Prepare Seasoning**:

    - In a small bowl, mix garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, pepper, and lemon zest.

3.  **Start Potatoes First**:

    - Toss diced potatoes with 1 tbsp oil and half the seasoning mixture.
    - Spread on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
    - Roast for 15 minutes.

4.  **Add Everything Else**:

    - Remove pan from oven.
    - Push potatoes to the sides of the pan.
    - Place salmon (skin-side down) in the center.
    - Arrange green beans on one side and cherry tomatoes on another.
    - Drizzle salmon and vegetables with remaining oil.
    - Sprinkle remaining seasoning over salmon and vegetables.

5.  **Roast**:

    - Return to oven for 12-15 minutes.
    - Salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and reaches 145°F internal temperature.
    - Cherry tomatoes should be bursting and green beans tender-crisp.

6.  **Finish**:
    - Squeeze fresh lemon over everything before serving.
    - Serve immediately.

## Notes

- **Timing**: If your salmon is very thick, it may need an extra 2-3 minutes. Thin fillets may cook faster.
