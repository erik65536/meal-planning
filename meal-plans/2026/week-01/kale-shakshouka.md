# Kale Shakshouka with Chickpeas

## Ingredients

### Sauce Base

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp paprika (smoked or sweet)
- 0.5 tsp chili powder or cayenne (to taste)
- 1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce

### The Eggs, Greens & Beans

- 4 large eggs
- 4 cups kale, chopped (stems removed)
- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- Nutritional yeast (for sprinkling)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Aromatics**:

    - Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
    - Sauté onion and bell pepper until soft (5-7 mins).
    - Add garlic and spices (cumin, paprika, chili powder). Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

2.  **Sauce**:

    - Pour in marinara sauce.
    - Add chickpeas and stir to combine.
    - Stir in kale until wilted (this may take 2-3 additions if your skillet is crowded).
    - Simmer for 5-10 minutes to thicken slightly and meld flavors.

3.  **Eggs**:

    - Make 4 small wells in the sauce with a spoon.
    - Crack an egg into each well.
    - Cover the pan. Simmer gently for 5-8 minutes until whites are set but yolks are still runny (or longer if you prefer firm yolks).

4.  **Finish**:
    - Sprinkle with nutritional yeast and fresh herbs.
    - Serve immediately from the pan with bread for dipping.
