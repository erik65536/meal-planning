## Ingredients

### Mashed Topping

- 1.5 lb russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 0.25 cup milk
- 0.5 tsp pepper
- 1 egg (for golden browning)

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut potatoes into evenly sized pieces (1-2 inch cubes) for consistent cooking
- Don't over-mix or potatoes will become gummy

### Filling

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb pre-cooked lamb, cubed
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2-3 carrots, sliced or diced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 2 tbsp flour (for thickening)
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 tsp pepper
- 1 cup frozen peas

**Prep Notes:**

- Vegetables should be diced small (1/4 to 1/2 inch) for even cooking
- Pre-cooked lamb just needs to be warmed through

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Boil Potatoes**:

    - Place cubed potatoes in a large pot. Cover with water.
    - Boil until tender (15-20 minutes).
    - Drain well.
    - Mash with milk and pepper.
    - Stir in egg. Set aside.

2.  **Cook Filling**:

    - Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
    - Add onion, carrots, and celery. Saute 5-7 minutes until soft.
    - Add garlic and tomato paste. Cook 1-2 minutes.
    - Sprinkle flour over vegetables and stir to coat.
    - Add lamb and stir to combine.
    - Pour in beef broth and Worcestershire sauce.
    - Add thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf.
    - Simmer for 10-15 minutes until thickened.
    - Stir in frozen peas.
    - Remove bay leaf. Season with pepper to taste.

3.  **Assemble**:

    - Preheat convection oven to 375°F.
    - Spread lamb filling evenly in the pan (or transfer to a 9x13 baking dish).
    - Top with mashed potatoes, spreading evenly.
    - Use a fork to create texture on top (helps browning).

4.  **Bake**: 20-25 minutes until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling.

5.  **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
