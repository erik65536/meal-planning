- 1 lime juice

### Assembly

**Prep Notes:**

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Make the Slaw**:

    - In a medium bowl, mix the Greek yogurt, cumin, and lime juice.
    - Toss with the cabbage and carrots until coated.
    - Refrigerate until serving.

2.  **Mix Seasoning**: Combine all spices in a small bowl.

3.  **Cook Filling**:

    - Heat avocado oil in a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high heat.
    - Add chicken or beef and half the seasoning. Cook until browned and nearly cooked through (5-7 mins). Remove from pan if needed to avoid overcrowding.
    - Add onions and peppers to the hot pan. Sauté until tender-crisp (3-5 mins).
    - Return meat to the pan. Add the remaining seasoning and splash of water if dry.
    - Cook for 1-2 minutes until everything is heated through.

4.  **Assemble**:
    - Warm tortillas in a dry skillet.
    - Fill with meat/veggie mixture.
    - Top with a generous portion of the yogurt cabbage slaw.
    - Add salsa to taste.
