## Ingredients

### Soup Base

- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
- 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed (1-inch pieces)
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 inch piece fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tbsp turmeric powder
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Coconut Finish

- 7 oz lite coconut milk (half of a 14 oz can)
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp water

### Crispy Chickpea Topping

- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and patted completely dry
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp paprika
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- 0.25 tsp salt
- Pinch of cayenne

**Prep Notes:**

- Pat chickpeas completely dry with paper towels for maximum crispiness
- Sweet potato should be cut into 1-inch cubes so it doesn't turn to mush
- Grate ginger on microplane for best distribution
- Lite coconut milk keeps this soup lighter while still creamy

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Roast Chickpeas**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast)
   - Toss completely dry chickpeas with oil, paprika, cumin, salt, and cayenne on sheet pan
   - Spread in single layer
   - Roast 20-25 minutes, shaking pan halfway through, until golden and crunchy
   - Set aside

2. **Make Soup Base**:
   - Heat olive oil in large pot over medium heat
   - Add onion and carrots, sauté 5-7 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic, ginger, and turmeric; cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant
   - Add cauliflower florets, sweet potato cubes, and vegetable broth
   - Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer
   - Cover and cook 20 minutes until all vegetables are very tender

3. **Blend**:
   - Use immersion blender to puree soup until completely smooth
   - Or carefully transfer in batches to regular blender
   - Sweet potato will add extra creaminess and natural sweetness

4. **Finish**:
   - Return soup to low heat
   - Stir in lite coconut milk
   - Mix cornstarch with water to make slurry
   - Stir cornstarch slurry into soup
   - Simmer 2-3 minutes, stirring, until slightly thickened
   - Fold in fresh spinach and stir until wilted (about 1 minute)

5. **Serve**:
   - Ladle soup into bowls
   - Top generously with crispy roasted chickpeas
   - Serve immediately

## Notes

- The sweet potato adds natural sweetness and extra body to the soup
- Lite coconut milk keeps calories in check while still providing richness
- Store soup and chickpeas separately to keep topping crispy
- Soup makes great leftovers and can be frozen (before adding coconut milk)
- Anti-inflammatory powerhouse with turmeric and ginger
- High in fiber from vegetables and chickpeas
