- 2 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup shredded cabbage or napa cabbage
- 0.5 cup shredded carrots
- 2 oz mushrooms, finely diced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 0.25 tsp white pepper

### Wrappers

- 8-10 dry spring roll wrappers (wheat-based)
- Water for sealing

### Blistered Vegetables

- 1 lb fresh green beans, trimmed
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 0.5 tsp sesame seeds

### For Cooking & Serving

- 3-4 tbsp neutral oil (for pan-frying)
- Sweet chili sauce
- Soy sauce or ponzu
- Sriracha mayo

**Prep Notes:**

- Squeeze excess moisture from cabbage and carrots before adding to filling
- Finely dice mushrooms so they integrate well
- Rice vinegar adds brightness to the filling
- Mix filling gently but thoroughly
- Keep wrappers covered with damp towel while working

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Filling**:
   - In a large bowl, combine ground pork, scallions, ginger, and garlic
   - Squeeze shredded cabbage and carrots in paper towels to remove excess moisture
   - Add cabbage, carrots, and diced mushrooms to bowl
   - Add soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and white pepper
   - Mix with hands or fork until well combined
   - Don't overmix - just until ingredients are evenly distributed

2. **Assemble Spring Rolls**:
   - Lay one spring roll wrapper flat with corner pointing toward you (diamond shape)
   - Place 2-3 tbsp filling in center, shaped into a horizontal log
   - Fold bottom corner up over filling
   - Fold left and right corners toward center
   - Roll tightly toward top corner, like a burrito
   - Brush top corner with water to seal
   - Place seam-side down on plate
   - Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers

3. **Pan-Fry Spring Rolls**:
   - Heat 2-3 tbsp neutral oil in large skillet over medium-high heat
   - Working in batches to avoid crowding, place rolls seam-side down
   - Fry 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy
   - Turn to cook all sides evenly
   - Internal temperature should reach 160°F for pork
   - Transfer to wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain

4. **Cook Blistered Vegetables**:
   - In the same skillet, drain most oil (leave about 1 tbsp)
   - Increase heat to high
   - Add green beans and whole cherry tomatoes
   - Let sit without stirring for 1-2 minutes to char
   - Toss and cook another 2-3 minutes
   - Green beans should be charred and tender-crisp
   - Tomatoes should begin to burst
   - Drizzle with soy sauce, sprinkle with sesame seeds
   - Toss and remove from heat

5. **Serve**:
   - Arrange spring rolls and blistered vegetables on plates
   - Serve with sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, and sriracha mayo for dipping

## Notes

- Cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms add texture and extra vegetables to filling
- Rice vinegar brightens the filling and balances the richness
- Squeezing moisture from vegetables prevents soggy rolls
- Pan-frying (not deep-frying) is lighter but still creates crispy exterior
- Save leftover cabbage for slow cooker short ribs later this week
- Spring rolls are best eaten immediately while crispy
- Can assemble rolls ahead and refrigerate up to 4 hours before frying
