# Lentil Shepherd's Pie with Cauliflower Mash

## Ingredients

### Lentil Filling

- 1 cup brown or green lentils, dry
- 2.5 cups vegetable broth
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 16 oz mushrooms, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 cup frozen peas
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

### Cauliflower Mash Topping

- 1 large head cauliflower (about 2 lbs), cut into florets
- 1 tbsp butter or olive oil
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 0.25 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

**Prep Notes:**

- Smaller lentil portion (1 cup vs 1.5) makes this lighter
- 16 oz mushrooms add substantial meaty texture and umami
- Dice mushrooms into small pieces so they integrate well
- Nutritional yeast adds cheesy, nutty flavor
- Parmesan adds richness to the mash
- Use brown or green lentils - they hold their shape

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Cook Lentil Filling**:
   - Heat olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat
   - Add onion, carrots, celery, and mushrooms
   - Sauté 7-10 minutes until vegetables are softened and mushrooms release their liquid
   - Add garlic, cook 1 minute
   - Stir in tomato paste, cook 2 minutes
   - Add lentils, vegetable broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf
   - Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer
   - Cook uncovered 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender
   - Most liquid should be absorbed (if too wet, simmer longer; if too dry, add splash of broth)
   - Stir in Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce
   - Fold in frozen peas
   - Remove bay leaf
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste

2. **Make Cauliflower Mash**:
   - While lentils cook, bring large pot of water to boil
   - Add cauliflower florets
   - Boil 10-12 minutes until very tender
   - Drain thoroughly and let steam off 2-3 minutes
   - Transfer to food processor
   - Add butter, nutritional yeast, Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
   - Blend until smooth and creamy
   - Taste and adjust seasoning

3. **Assemble**:
   - Preheat oven to 375°F (convection bake)
   - Spread lentil-mushroom filling evenly in 9x13 inch baking dish
   - Dollop cauliflower mash over filling
   - Spread gently to cover completely
   - Use fork to create ridges on surface (helps with browning)

4. **Bake**:
   - Bake 20 minutes until filling is bubbling at edges
   - Turn on broiler to high
   - Broil 2-3 minutes until peaks of mash are golden brown
   - Watch closely to prevent burning

5. **Rest & Serve**:
   - Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving
   - This allows filling to set and makes portioning easier
   - Scoop generous portions onto plates

## Notes

- Worcestershire and soy sauce add deep umami that mimics meat
- 16 oz mushrooms (1 lb) creates substantial, satisfying texture
- Nutritional yeast + Parmesan combination in mash is flavor-packed
- Using 1 cup lentils instead of 1.5 makes this lighter while mushrooms add bulk
- Vegetarian but very satisfying and protein-rich
- Great for meal prep - reheat portions in microwave
- The combination of lentils (protein/fiber) and mushrooms (umami) is incredibly filling
