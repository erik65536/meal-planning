# Slow Cooker Short Ribs with Beer & Red Wine

## Ingredients

### Short Ribs

- 3-4 lbs bone-in beef short ribs
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp paprika
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for searing, optional)

### Vegetables

- 4-5 large red potatoes or Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 celery stalks, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 medium onions, cut into thick wedges
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 cups cabbage, cut into thick wedges (leftover from spring rolls)

### Braising Liquid & Seasonings

- 1 cup beef broth
- 0.5 cup red wine
- 0.5 cup beer (lager or ale)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 bay leaf

**Prep Notes:**

- Short ribs are more marbled than brisket - incredibly rich and tender
- Use waxy potatoes (red or Yukon gold) that hold their shape
- Cabbage wedges add substance and soak up delicious flavors
- Add cabbage in last 2 hours so it doesn't turn to mush
- Combination of red wine, beer, and balsamic creates complex depth

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Optional Searing** (Recommended):
   - Season short ribs all over with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder
   - Heat olive oil in large skillet over high heat
   - Sear short ribs 3-4 minutes per side until deep brown crust forms
   - This adds incredible flavor but can be skipped if pressed for time

2. **Layer Slow Cooker**:
   - Place potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions in bottom of slow cooker
   - Nestle garlic cloves among vegetables
   - Place seared short ribs on top of vegetables (bone side down if possible)
   - Add thyme sprigs and bay leaf

3. **Make Braising Liquid**:
   - In bowl or measuring cup, whisk together:
     - Beef broth
     - Red wine
     - Beer
     - Tomato paste (whisk until no lumps)
     - Worcestershire sauce
     - Balsamic vinegar
     - Dijon mustard
   - Pour mixture over and around short ribs

4. **Slow Cook**:
   - Cover and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours
   - After 4-5 hours, add cabbage wedges, nestling them into liquid
   - Continue cooking until short ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender
   - Don't lift lid except to add cabbage

5. **Finish**:
   - Transfer short ribs to platter carefully (they'll be very tender)
   - Use slotted spoon to remove vegetables to serving platter
   - Remove bay leaf and thyme stems
   - Optional: Skim fat from cooking liquid or pour through fat separator
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper

6. **Serve**:
   - Arrange short ribs and vegetables on plates
   - Ladle rich cooking liquid over everything as gravy
   - The meat should be falling off the bone

## Notes

- Short ribs cook faster than brisket (6-7 hours vs 8-9)
- Red wine + beer + balsamic + Dijon creates incredibly complex, rich sauce
- Celery adds aromatic depth to the vegetable base
- Cabbage is perfect for soaking up the braising liquid - use leftover from spring rolls
- This is an incredibly rich, comforting meal
- The bone marrow in short ribs adds amazing richness to the sauce
- Leftovers are phenomenal - meat gets even more tender
- If sauce is thin, transfer to saucepan and simmer to reduce
- For thicker gravy, mix 2 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp cold water, stir into liquid, simmer 2-3 minutes
- Cabbage transforms from sharp to sweet and tender during cooking
