# Cast Iron Cauliflower Pizza (Two 10" Pizzas)

## Ingredients

### Cauliflower Crust (for 2 pizzas)

- 4 cups riced cauliflower (about 1 large head)
- 1 large egg
- 0.5 cup low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 0.25 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

### Pizza Toppings

- 0.75 cup pizza sauce or marinara (divided)
- 2 Italian sausage links, pre-cooked and sliced thick
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 0.25 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1.5 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded (divided)
- 0.25 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- Fresh basil leaves (about 8-10 leaves per pizza)
- 2-3 tbsp olive oil (for greasing skillets)

**Prep Notes:**

- Steam or microwave cauliflower until very soft, then squeeze out ALL moisture in a towel - this is critical
- Pre-cook sausage completely before slicing thick (about 1/2 inch coins)
- Divide all topping ingredients between the two pizzas
- Fresh basil should be added after baking to prevent burning

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Cauliflower**:
   - Rice cauliflower in food processor if starting with fresh head
   - Microwave riced cauliflower in covered bowl for 8-10 minutes until very soft
   - Let cool 5 minutes, then wrap in clean kitchen towel and squeeze aggressively to remove all water
   - You should extract 1/2 to 1 cup of liquid

2. **Make Crust "Dough"**:
   - Transfer squeezed cauliflower to bowl
   - Add egg, mozzarella, Parmesan, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper
   - Mix thoroughly with hands until cohesive dough forms
   - Divide mixture in half for two pizzas

3. **Pre-Cook Sausage**:
   - While preparing crust, cook sausage links in skillet over medium heat
   - Cook 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through (160°F)
   - Let rest 5 minutes, then slice into thick 1/2 inch coins
   - Set aside

4. **Blind Bake Crusts**:
   - Preheat oven to 425°F (standard bake)
   - Generously oil two 10-inch cast iron skillets
   - Press half the cauliflower mixture into each skillet in even layer
   - Bake both pans 10-15 minutes until edges are golden and crust is firm to touch

5. **Add Toppings**:
   - Remove pans from oven
   - Spread about 1/3 cup sauce on each crust
   - Sprinkle 0.5 cup mozzarella on each pizza
   - Divide sausage slices, bell pepper, and onion between pizzas
   - Top each with remaining mozzarella (about 0.25 cup per pizza)
   - Sprinkle Parmesan over both

6. **Final Bake**:
   - Return both pans to oven
   - Bake 10-12 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly and sausage is heated through
   - If cheese needs more browning, broil 1-2 minutes

7. **Finish & Serve**:
   - Remove from oven and let cool 3-5 minutes
   - Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter over both pizzas
   - Cut each pizza into 4-6 wedges
   - Serve hot

## Notes

- Two 10" pizzas are perfect for meal prep or feeding multiple people
- Pre-cooking the sausage thick keeps it juicy and prevents overcooking
- Adding garlic to the crust adds wonderful flavor depth
- Fresh basil after baking keeps it bright and aromatic
- Cauliflower crust is more delicate than traditional - use fork and knife or support slices from underneath
- Each pizza serves 2-3 people depending on appetite
