# Savory Crepes (Winter Florentine)

## Ingredients

### Crepe Batter

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 0.5 cup milk
- 0.5 cup water
- 2 tbsp melted butter (plus more for cooking)
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 tbsp fresh oregano leaves (or 1 tsp dried)

### Savory Filling

- 8 oz mushrooms (cremini or button), sliced
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 1 cup cooked chicken, shredded
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp butter
- 0.25 cup white wine
- 2 tbsp heavy cream
- Pinch of nutmeg (about 1/8 tsp)
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

### Cheese

- 4-6 slices Swiss cheese or Gruyère

### Roasted Vegetable Side

- 1 large crown broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into thick sticks
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

**Prep Notes:**

- Batter MUST rest 30 minutes (or overnight) for best texture
- Fresh herbs in batter add wonderful flavor
- Sauté mushrooms until completely dry to prevent watery filling
- Nutmeg adds warm, subtle complexity to the filling
- White wine adds acidity that brightens the rich filling

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Make Crepe Batter**:
   - Combine flour, eggs, milk, water, melted butter, salt, thyme, and oregano in blender
   - Blend until completely smooth, about 30 seconds
   - Let rest at room temperature 30 minutes (or refrigerate overnight)
   - Stir before using

2. **Roast Vegetables**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast)
   - Toss broccoli florets and carrot sticks with olive oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic
   - Spread on sheet pan in single layer
   - Roast 20-25 minutes until broccoli is crispy at edges and carrots are tender
   - Broccoli will finish first; remove if needed and let carrots continue
   - Keep warm

3. **Cook Filling**:
   - Heat butter in large skillet over medium-high heat
   - Add sliced mushrooms
   - Cook 5-7 minutes without stirring much, until browned and liquid evaporates
   - Add garlic, cook 30 seconds
   - Add white wine, cook 1-2 minutes until mostly evaporated
   - Add spinach, cook until wilted (1-2 minutes)
   - Stir in shredded chicken, heavy cream, and nutmeg
   - Season with salt and pepper
   - Remove from heat, keep warm

4. **Cook Crepes**:
   - Heat 8-10 inch non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat
   - Lightly butter the pan
   - Pour about 1/4 cup batter into pan
   - Immediately tilt and swirl to spread thinly across bottom
   - Cook 1-2 minutes until edges lift and bottom is lightly golden
   - Flip with spatula
   - Cook other side 30-60 seconds
   - Slide onto plate
   - Repeat with remaining batter, stacking crepes

5. **Assemble & Serve**:
   - Return skillet to low-medium heat
   - Place one crepe back in pan
   - On one half, add 1 slice cheese and generous spoonful of filling
   - Fold crepe in half, then in half again (triangle shape)
   - Heat 1-2 minutes until cheese melts
   - Slide onto plate
   - Repeat with remaining crepes
   - Serve 2-3 crepes per person with roasted broccoli and carrots on the side

## Notes

- Fresh thyme and oregano in batter adds wonderful herbed flavor throughout
- White wine adds brightness and depth to mushroom filling
- Nutmeg is traditional in French crepes - just a pinch transforms the dish
- Adding carrots to broccoli creates more colorful, varied vegetable side
- Carrots take longer to roast than broccoli - cut them thick so they finish together
- Crepes can be made ahead and reheated (stack with parchment between, refrigerate 3 days)
- First crepe is usually imperfect - don't worry, it's the "test" crepe
- Resting the batter is crucial - allows flour to hydrate for tender crepes
