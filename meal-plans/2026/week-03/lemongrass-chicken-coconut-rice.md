# Vietnamese Lemongrass Chicken Breast & Coconut Rice

## Ingredients

### Chicken & Marinade

- 1.5 lbs chicken breast (about 2-3 large breasts)
- 2 tbsp lemongrass powder
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp neutral oil

### Roasted Vegetables

- 4-5 Roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 1 bell pepper, cut into thick strips
- 1 medium onion, cut into thick wedges

### Coconut Rice (Lower Carb Portion)

- 0.5 cup jasmine rice, rinsed
- 3.5 oz lite coconut milk (quarter of a 14 oz can)
- 0.5 cup water
- 0.25 tsp salt

**Prep Notes:**

- Marinate chicken minimum 30 minutes, preferably 2-4 hours
- Lemongrass powder is convenient and disperses evenly in marinade
- Using chicken breast instead of thighs reduces fat and calories
- Smaller rice portion (0.5 cup dry) keeps carbs/calories lower
- Score chicken breast for better marinade penetration

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Marinate Chicken**:
   - In a bowl or zip-top bag, combine lemongrass powder, fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, garlic, soy sauce, black pepper, and oil
   - Score chicken breasts with shallow cuts in crosshatch pattern
   - Add chicken and turn to coat completely
   - Refrigerate minimum 30 minutes (2-4 hours ideal)

2. **Prepare Rice**:
   - Rinse jasmine rice until water runs clear
   - Combine rice, lite coconut milk, water, and salt in small pot
   - Bring to boil over high heat
   - Immediately reduce to lowest heat, cover tightly
   - Cook 15 minutes without lifting lid
   - Remove from heat, let rest covered 5-10 minutes
   - Fluff with fork

3. **Roast Chicken & Vegetables**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast preferred)
   - Arrange chicken breasts on rimmed sheet pan
   - Arrange tomato halves, bell pepper strips, and onion wedges around chicken
   - Pour any remaining marinade over chicken
   - Roast 20-25 minutes until chicken reaches 165°F internal temperature
   - Chicken breast cooks faster than thighs - watch closely to avoid drying out
   - Vegetables should be soft and slightly charred

4. **Rest & Serve**:
   - Let chicken rest 5 minutes before slicing
   - Slice chicken breast on the bias for presentation
   - Fluff coconut rice and portion onto plates
   - Arrange sliced chicken and roasted vegetables alongside rice
   - Drizzle any pan juices over chicken
   - Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired

## Notes

- Chicken breast is leaner than thighs but can dry out if overcooked - use meat thermometer
- Lemongrass powder provides authentic flavor without prep work of fresh lemongrass
- Bell peppers add sweetness and extra vegetables
- Reduced rice portion (0.5 cup dry makes about 1.5 cups cooked) keeps this lighter
- Total carbs per serving: approximately 30-35g (vs 50-60g with larger rice portion)
- Fish sauce is essential for authentic Vietnamese flavor
- Lime juice adds brightness that balances the sweet and savory
