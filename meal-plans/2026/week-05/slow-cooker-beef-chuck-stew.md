# Slow Cooker Beef Chuck Stew with Root Vegetables

## Ingredients

### Beef

- 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for searing)

### Vegetables

- 1 lb Yukon Gold or red potatoes, cut into 1.5-inch chunks
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1.5-inch pieces
- 3 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1.5-inch pieces
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed

### Braising Liquid & Seasonings

- 3 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 tsp smoked paprika

### Optional Add-Ins

- 8 oz mushrooms, quartered (add at start)
- 1 cup butternut squash, cubed (add at start)
- 1 cup frozen peas (add in last 15 minutes)
- 1 cup pearl onions, peeled (add at start)
- 0.5 cup red wine (replace 0.5 cup broth)
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (stir in at end for depth)
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (replace dried)

**Prep Notes:**

- Searing the beef first is optional but builds much better flavor through browning
- Cut vegetables into large chunks so they hold their shape during the long cook
- Coat beef in flour before searing to help thicken the stew naturally
- Use waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold or red) that won't fall apart

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Optional Searing** (Recommended):
   - Toss beef cubes with flour, salt, and pepper
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat
   - Sear beef in batches, 2-3 minutes per side until deep brown crust forms
   - Don't crowd the pan or the meat will steam instead of sear
   - Transfer seared beef to slow cooker

2. **Layer Slow Cooker**:
   - If skipping searing, toss beef with flour, salt, and pepper and add directly to slow cooker
   - Place potatoes, carrots, celery, parsnips, and onion in slow cooker
   - Nestle garlic cloves among vegetables
   - Add any optional add-ins that go in at the start (mushrooms, squash, pearl onions)
   - Place beef on top of vegetables
   - Add bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary

3. **Make Braising Liquid**:
   - In a bowl, whisk together beef broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and smoked paprika
   - If using red wine, replace 0.5 cup of the broth
   - Pour liquid over everything in the slow cooker

4. **Slow Cook**:
   - Cover and cook on LOW for 7-8 hours or HIGH for 4-5 hours
   - Beef chuck is done when it's fork-tender and falls apart easily
   - Don't lift the lid during cooking except to add peas near the end

5. **Finish**:
   - Remove bay leaf and thyme stems
   - If using frozen peas, stir them in during the last 15 minutes on high
   - If using balsamic vinegar, stir in 1 tbsp now
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper
   - If stew is too thin, mix 1 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp cold water, stir in, and cook 10 minutes on high to thicken

6. **Serve**:
   - Ladle stew into bowls
   - Serve with crusty bread if desired

## Notes

- Beef chuck is ideal for slow cooking — the collagen breaks down into gelatin, making the stew rich and silky
- Searing adds deep, caramelized flavor but can be skipped on busy mornings
- Parsnips add natural sweetness and earthy depth to the broth
- Low-sodium broth keeps the sodium in check while you control the salt level
- This stew tastes even better the next day as flavors meld overnight
- Freezes well for up to 3 months
