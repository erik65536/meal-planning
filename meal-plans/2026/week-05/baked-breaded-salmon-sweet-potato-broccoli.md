### Za'atar Roasted Vegetables

- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 1.5 tbsp za'atar seasoning
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

**Prep Notes:**

- Sweet potatoes need more time than broccoli, so they go in the oven first
- Follow package instructions for the breaded salmon fillets

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Roast Sweet Potatoes**:
   - Toss sweet potato cubes with 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp za'atar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
   - Spread in single layer on a lined baking sheet
   - Roast for 15 minutes

3. **Add Broccoli**:
   - Toss broccoli florets with remaining 1 tbsp olive oil and 0.5 tbsp za'atar
   - After 15 minutes, add broccoli to the sheet pan with sweet potatoes
   - Toss gently and spread back into a single layer
   - Continue roasting 10 minutes

4. **Add Salmon**:
   - Place breaded salmon fillets on the second lined baking sheet
   - Follow package instructions for temperature and time (typically 20-25 minutes at 400°F)
   - Time it so the salmon goes in the oven alongside the vegetables
   - Salmon should be golden and flaky when done

5. **Finish & Serve**:
   - Remove everything from oven
   - Drizzle lemon juice over vegetables
   - Plate salmon alongside za'atar roasted vegetables
