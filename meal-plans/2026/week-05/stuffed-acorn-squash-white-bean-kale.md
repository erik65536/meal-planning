# Stuffed Acorn Squash with White Bean, Kale & Cranberry Filling

## Ingredients

### Squash

- 2 acorn squash
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for brushing)
- Pinch of salt and pepper

### Filling

- 1 can (15 oz) cannellini beans (white kidney beans), rinsed and drained
- 4 cups lacinato or curly kale, stems removed and roughly chopped
- 1 medium apple (Honeycrisp or Granny Smith), diced small
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 0.25 cup dried cranberries
- 2 tbsp chopped pecans or walnuts
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried sage
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme
- 0.25 tsp cinnamon
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 0.25 cup low-sodium vegetable broth

### For Serving

- Drizzle of balsamic glaze (optional)
- Fresh parsley or sage, chopped

**Prep Notes:**

- To make cutting acorn squash easier, microwave whole for 1-2 minutes to soften the skin slightly
- Cut squash in half vertically (stem to bottom) and scoop out seeds
- White beans replace both the sausage and rice from the classic recipe — they provide protein, fiber, and creaminess with fewer calories
- Kale wilts down significantly, so don't worry about the volume

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Roast Squash**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F
   - Cut squash in half vertically and scoop out seeds
   - Brush cut sides with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper
   - Place cut-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet
   - Roast 30-35 minutes until tender when pierced with a fork

2. **Make Filling**:
   - While squash roasts, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat
   - Add diced onion and cook 4-5 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic, sage, thyme, cinnamon, and nutmeg
   - Cook 30 seconds until fragrant
   - Add chopped kale and vegetable broth
   - Cook 3-4 minutes, tossing frequently, until kale is wilted and tender
   - Add diced apple, cannellini beans, dried cranberries, salt, and pepper
   - Cook 3-4 minutes until apple is slightly softened and beans are heated through
   - Stir in apple cider vinegar and pecans
   - Taste and adjust seasoning

3. **Stuff & Bake**:
   - Flip roasted squash cut-side up on the baking sheet
   - Mound filling generously into each squash half
   - Return to oven for 10-12 minutes until filling is heated through and edges are lightly crisped

4. **Serve**:
   - Plate stuffed squash halves
   - Drizzle with balsamic glaze if using
   - Garnish with fresh herbs

## Notes

- Acorn squash is high in vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber
- White beans provide protein and fiber to make this filling without meat or grains
- Kale adds iron, calcium, and antioxidants
- Cranberries and apple provide a sweet contrast to the earthy sage and squash
- Apple cider vinegar brightens the filling and keeps it from tasting heavy
- The balsamic glaze drizzle adds sweetness and acidity without many calories
- Each stuffed half is a satisfying serving — hearty but lighter than the sausage-and-rice version
- Leftovers reheat well in the oven at 350°F for 10-15 minutes
