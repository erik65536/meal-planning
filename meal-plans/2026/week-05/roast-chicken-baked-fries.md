# Roast Whole Chicken with Baked Russet Fries

## Ingredients

### Whole Chicken

- 1 whole young chicken (3-4 lbs)
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Chicken Spice Rub

- 1.5 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme
- 0.5 tsp dried oregano
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp black pepper

### Baked Fries

- 3-4 large russet potatoes
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil

### Fry Seasoning

- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp onion powder
- 0.5 tsp dried rosemary, crushed
- 0.5 tsp dried oregano
- 0.5 tsp black pepper

### For Serving

- Fresh parsley, chopped

**Prep Notes:**

- **Defrosting**: Move chicken from freezer to refrigerator 24-48 hours before cooking. 24 hours is usually enough for a bird under 4 lbs, but 48 hours is safer for larger birds. Place on a plate or tray on the lowest refrigerator shelf to catch any drips. Chicken is fully thawed when there are no ice crystals in the cavity and the legs move freely. Never defrost at room temperature.
- Pat the chicken completely dry inside and out before seasoning for crispy skin
- No butter needed — olive oil and the bold spice rub produce a flavorful, crispy skin on their own
- Soaking cut fries in cold water for 30 minutes removes excess starch for crispier results

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Chicken**:
   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to take off the chill
   - Preheat oven to 425°F
   - Pat chicken completely dry with paper towels inside and out
   - Mix all spice rub ingredients in a small bowl
   - Rub olive oil all over the chicken
   - Sprinkle seasoning blend generously all over and inside the cavity
   - Tuck wing tips under the body
   - Tie legs together with kitchen twine if desired
   - Place chicken breast-side up on a roasting rack in a roasting pan

2. **Prepare Fries**:
   - Cut russet potatoes into 0.25 to 0.5 inch thick fries
   - Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain and pat completely dry
   - Toss with olive oil and all fry seasoning
   - Spread in a single layer on a lined baking sheet (use two sheets if needed to avoid crowding)

3. **Roast Chicken**:
   - Place chicken in oven at 425°F
   - Roast for 20 minutes at 425°F to crisp the skin
   - Reduce temperature to 375°F
   - Continue roasting 40-60 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165°F in the thickest part of the thigh
   - Total time is approximately 1 to 1.25 hours for a 3-4 lb bird

4. **Bake Fries**:
   - Place fries in oven when you reduce the chicken temperature to 375°F
   - Alternatively, bake fries at 425°F on a separate rack or after chicken comes out
   - Bake 25-35 minutes, flipping halfway through
   - Fries are done when golden and crispy on the edges

5. **Rest and Serve**:
   - Remove chicken from oven and let rest 10-15 minutes before carving
   - Resting is critical — juices redistribute throughout the meat
   - Carve chicken and plate with baked fries
   - Garnish with fresh parsley

## Notes

- The smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne blend gives deep, savory flavor without excess sodium or butter
- Soaking fries in cold water removes starch for noticeably crispier results
- Internal temp of 165°F in the thigh is the safe target for juicy chicken
- Save the carcass for homemade bone broth — freeze in a bag if not making immediately
- Leftover chicken can be shredded for tacos, salads, or sandwiches later in the week
