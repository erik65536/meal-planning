**Prep Notes:**

- Make pickled onions first so they have time to marinate (at least 20 minutes, longer is better)
- Sweet potatoes can be roasted in the oven or cooked in a skillet
- The cilantro lime slaw doubles as a fresh, crunchy, low-calorie side dish and a taco topping

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Make Pickled Red Onions**:
   - Thinly slice red onion and place in a jar or bowl
   - Whisk together apple cider vinegar, warm water, sugar, and salt until dissolved
   - Pour over onions and let sit at least 20 minutes
   - These keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks

2. **Prepare Cilantro Lime Slaw**:
   - In a medium bowl, combine shredded cabbage, carrots, and cilantro
   - Whisk together lime juice, olive oil, cumin, and salt
   - Toss with cabbage mixture and refrigerate until serving

3. **Cook Sweet Potatoes**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F
   - Toss diced sweet potatoes with olive oil, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, and salt
   - Spread in single layer on a lined baking sheet
   - Roast 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until tender and lightly caramelized

4. **Warm Black Beans**:
   - In a small saucepan, warm black beans over medium heat with a splash of water
   - Season with a pinch of cumin and salt
   - Lightly mash about a third of the beans for a creamier texture

5. **Assemble Tacos**:
   - Warm tortillas in a dry skillet or directly over a gas flame
   - Layer each tortilla with black beans, roasted sweet potatoes, pickled red onions, and cilantro lime slaw
   - Top with cotija cheese, fresh cilantro, and hot sauce or salsa verde
   - Squeeze extra lime over the top

6. **Serve**:
   - Plate tacos with remaining cilantro lime slaw on the side
