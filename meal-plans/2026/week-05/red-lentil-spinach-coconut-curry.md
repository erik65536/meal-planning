# Red Lentil & Spinach Coconut Curry

## Ingredients

### Curry

- 1 cup dried red lentils, rinsed
- 1 can (13.5 oz) light coconut milk
- 1.5 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 4 cups fresh spinach (or 1 cup frozen spinach)
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced (or 1 tsp ground ginger)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or coconut oil

### Spices

- 1.5 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp garam masala
- 0.25 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

### For Serving

- 0.5 cup basmati rice per person (optional)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges

**Prep Notes:**

- Red lentils cook quickly (15-20 minutes) and naturally break down into a creamy texture — no blending needed
- Light coconut milk keeps calories lower than full-fat while still providing creaminess
- This is a complete protein meal from lentils alone

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Cook Rice** (if serving with rice):
   - Rinse rice until water runs clear
   - Cook according to package directions
   - Keep warm until serving

2. **Sauté Aromatics**:
   - Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat
   - Add diced onion and cook 4-5 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic and ginger, cook 1 minute until fragrant
   - Add all spices and stir 30 seconds until toasted and aromatic

3. **Cook Lentils**:
   - Add rinsed red lentils, coconut milk, vegetable broth, and diced tomatoes
   - Stir to combine
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer
   - Cook uncovered 18-22 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender and broken down
   - The curry will thicken naturally as the lentils cook

4. **Add Spinach**:
   - Stir in spinach and cook 2-3 minutes until wilted
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime

5. **Serve**:
   - Ladle curry over basmati rice or serve on its own
   - Garnish with fresh cilantro and lime wedges

## Notes

- Red lentils are high in protein and fiber, making this very filling despite being plant-based
- Turmeric provides curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound
- Light coconut milk provides creaminess at a fraction of the calories of full-fat
- Spinach adds iron, folate, and antioxidants
- This is a budget-friendly, warming winter meal packed with phytonutrients
- Leftovers thicken when refrigerated — add a splash of broth when reheating
- Freezes well for up to 3 months
