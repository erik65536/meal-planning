**Prep Notes:**

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Roast Cauliflower**:
   - Toss cauliflower florets with olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes
   - Spread in single layer on the lined baking sheet
   - Roast for 15 minutes

3. **Add Tomatoes**:
   - After 15 minutes, scatter cherry tomatoes onto the baking sheet with the cauliflower
   - Toss gently and spread back into a single layer
   - Return to oven for 5 more minutes

4. **Prepare Cod**:
   - While vegetables roast, mix olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, dill, salt, and pepper in a small bowl
   - Pat cod fillets dry with paper towels
   - Place on a separate small baking sheet or dish lined with parchment
   - Spoon the lemon herb mixture evenly over each fillet

5. **Bake Cod**:
   - Place cod in oven alongside the vegetables
   - Bake 12-15 minutes until cod is opaque and flakes easily with a fork
   - Internal temperature should reach 145°F

6. **Serve**:
   - Plate cod fillets alongside roasted cauliflower and burst cherry tomatoes
   - Spoon any tomato juices from the pan over the fish
   - Scatter capers over the top if using
   - Garnish with fresh herbs and lemon wedges

## Notes

- Cod is a lean white fish that's high in protein and very low in calories
- Cod provides omega-3 fatty acids (less than salmon but still beneficial)

- This is one of the lightest meals of the week — very low calorie but satisfying

- The burst cherry tomatoes create a flavorful, no-effort sauce
- Capers add briny, Mediterranean flavor without adding significant calories
