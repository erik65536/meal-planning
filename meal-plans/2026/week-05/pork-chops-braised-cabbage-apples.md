# Bone-In Pork Chops with Braised Green Cabbage & Apples

## Ingredients

### Pork Chops

- 4 bone-in pork chops (about 1-inch thick)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp onion powder
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper

### Braised Cabbage & Apples

- 1 large head green cabbage, cored and sliced into 0.5-inch ribbons
- 2 medium apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), cored and sliced thin
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 0.5 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 tsp caraway seeds
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)

**Prep Notes:**

- Pat pork chops dry for a better sear
- Green cabbage holds up well to braising and turns sweet and tender
- Granny Smith apples hold their shape during cooking; Honeycrisp will be softer and sweeter
- This becomes a one-pan meal after the initial sear

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Season Pork Chops**:
   - Pat pork chops completely dry with paper towels
   - Mix smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, salt, and pepper in a small bowl
   - Season both sides of pork chops generously

2. **Sear Pork Chops**:
   - Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
   - Sear pork chops 3-4 minutes per side until a golden brown crust forms
   - Remove pork chops to a plate and set aside (they will finish cooking later)

3. **Start the Braise**:
   - In the same pan, add 1 tbsp olive oil if needed
   - Add sliced onion and cook 3-4 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic and caraway seeds, cook 30 seconds until fragrant
   - Add sliced cabbage in batches, tossing to wilt slightly before adding more
   - Add apple slices, apple cider vinegar, chicken broth, thyme, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper
   - Stir everything to combine

4. **Braise Together**:
   - Nestle the seared pork chops on top of the cabbage mixture
   - Pour any accumulated juices from the plate into the pan
   - Cover with lid and reduce heat to medium-low
   - Cook 20-25 minutes until pork reaches 145°F internal temperature and cabbage is tender

5. **Serve**:
   - Plate pork chops on a bed of braised cabbage and apples
   - Spoon pan juices over the top

## Notes

- Bone-in pork chops stay juicier than boneless during cooking
- Pork is safely done at 145°F — use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking
- Braised cabbage with apples is a classic German-inspired combination
- Caraway seeds are traditional with cabbage and add warm, earthy flavor
- Apple cider vinegar brightens the dish and balances the sweetness of the apples
- Green cabbage is very low in calories but high in vitamin C and fiber
- This is a complete, hearty meal without being heavy
- Leftovers reheat well — the cabbage gets even better the next day
