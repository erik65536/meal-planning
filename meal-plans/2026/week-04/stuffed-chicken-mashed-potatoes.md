### Day 1: Make Cornbread

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F.
2. **Mix Batter**: In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add melted butter, honey, egg, and buttermilk. Whisk until just combined.
3. **Bake**: Pour into a greased 9-inch square baking pan. Bake for 22-24 minutes until top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean.
4. **Cool**: Let cool completely on counter overnight, uncovered.
   **Make Stuffing Base**: In a large bowl, whisk together broth and egg. Set aside.
5. **Cook Filling**: Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add celery, thyme, sage, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook 4 minutes until vegetables soften.
6. **Combine**: Pour vegetable mixture (including any liquid) into the broth-egg mixture. Add toasted cornbread cubes. Gently fold together. Let cool to room temperature.

### Stuff and Cook Chicken

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F.
2. **Butterfly**: Place chicken breasts on cutting board. Using a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut horizontally through the thickest part, stopping about 0.5 inch from the edge (like opening a book). Open and gently pound to even thickness (about 0.75 inch).
3. **Season**: Season the inside with salt and pepper.
4. **Stuff**: Place 0.5-0.75 cup stuffing mixture on one half of each breast. Fold over and secure with toothpicks. Season outside with salt and pepper.
5. **Sear**: Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear stuffed chicken 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown.
6. **Bake**: Transfer skillet to oven and bake 20-25 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165°F. Let rest 5 minutes before removing toothpicks.

### Make Mashed Potatoes & Gravy

1. **Make Mashed Potatoes**:
   - Boil potatoes in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender
   - Drain and return to pot
   - Mash with butter and milk until smooth
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste

2. **Prepare Gravy**:
