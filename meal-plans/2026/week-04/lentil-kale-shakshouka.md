## Ingredients

### Sauce Base

- 1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5 tsp chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Lentils & Greens

- 1 cup dried green or brown lentils (or 2.5 cups cooked lentils)
- 4 cups kale, stems removed and chopped
- 0.5 cup water or vegetable broth

### The Eggs

- 4-6 large eggs

### For Serving

- 0.5 cup Greek yogurt
- Bread for dipping

**Prep Notes:**

- Cook lentils ahead of time for quicker assembly
- Use a wide skillet with a lid - you need surface area for the eggs
- Remove kale stems for better texture

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Cook Lentils** (if starting with dried):
   - Rinse lentils and place in pot with 2.5 cups water
   - Bring to boil, reduce to simmer
   - Cook 20-25 minutes until tender but still holding shape
   - Drain and set aside

2. **Make Sauce Base**:
   - Heat olive oil in large, wide skillet over medium heat
   - Add diced onion and bell pepper
   - Sauté 5-7 minutes until vegetables are soft
   - Add minced garlic, cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder
   - Cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly
   - Season with salt and pepper

3. **Add Lentils & Kale**:
   - Pour marinara sauce into skillet and stir to combine
   - Add cooked lentils and mix well
   - Add chopped kale and water/broth
   - Stir until kale begins to wilt (about 2-3 minutes)
   - Let simmer 5-10 minutes to meld flavors and fully wilt kale
   - Taste and adjust seasonings

4. **Add Eggs**:
   - Using a spoon, make 4-6 small wells in the sauce, spacing them evenly
   - Gently crack an egg into each well
   - Season tops of eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper
   - Cover the skillet with lid
   - Simmer gently for 5-8 minutes until egg whites are set but yolks are still runny
   - For firmer yolks, cook 2-3 minutes longer

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove from heat
   - Dollop Greek yogurt over top
   - Serve immediately from the pan with crusty bread for dipping

## Notes

- Lentils add protein and fiber, making this more filling
- Marinara sauce keeps this simple and weeknight-friendly
- Greek yogurt adds cooling contrast to the spicy tomato sauce
- This is excellent for breakfast, lunch, or dinner
- Kale provides extra nutrition and heartiness
- Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase risk of foodborne illness
- Store leftovers without eggs, then poach fresh eggs when reheating
