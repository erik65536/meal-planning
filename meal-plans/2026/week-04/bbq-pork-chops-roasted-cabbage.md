## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F.

2. **Prepare Cabbage**:
   - Remove outer leaves from cabbage
   - Cut cabbage vertically into 1-inch thick slices (steaks)
   - You should get 4-6 steaks from one head
   - Keep core intact so steaks hold together
   - Brush both sides with olive oil
   - Sprinkle with garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, thyme, caraway seeds (if using), salt, and pepper
   - Arrange on a large baking sheet

3. **Start Roasting Cabbage**:
   - Place cabbage steaks in oven
   - Roast for 15 minutes

4. **Prepare Frozen Veggies**:
   - Spread frozen veggie mix on a separate baking sheet
   - Drizzle with olive oil
   - Toss with garlic powder, salt, and pepper
   - Set aside (will go in oven later)

5. **Prepare Pork Chops**:
   - Pat pork chops dry with paper towels
   - Season both sides with smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
   - Brush generously with BBQ sauce on both sides

6. **Add Pork Chops and Veggies to Oven**:
   - After cabbage has roasted 15 minutes, flip the cabbage steaks
   - Place pork chops on a separate baking sheet or in a baking dish
   - Pour remaining BBQ sauce over pork chops
   - Place pork chops in oven alongside cabbage
   - Add the prepared frozen veggie sheet to oven as well
   - Roast all together for 20-25 minutes until pork reaches 145°F internal temperature

7. **Finish Cabbage**:
   - When cabbage is tender and edges are caramelized (about 35-40 minutes total), remove from oven
   - Drizzle with apple cider vinegar while still hot
   - Toss roasted veggies to ensure even browning

8. **Rest and Serve**:
   - Let pork chops rest 5 minutes
   - Plate pork chops with roasted cabbage steaks and roasted veggies
   - Garnish with fresh parsley

## Notes

- Bone-in pork chops stay juicier than boneless
- Internal temp should reach 145°F for safe, juicy pork
- Cabbage transforms when roasted - sweet and caramelized
- Cabbage is in season during winter months and very affordable
- One head of cabbage provides lots of volume for minimal calories
- Apple cider vinegar brightens the caramelized cabbage
- Caraway seeds add traditional flavor that pairs well with cabbage and pork
- This is a hearty, winter-appropriate meal without being heavy
- Leftover cabbage steaks reheat well
