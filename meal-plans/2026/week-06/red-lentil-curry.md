# Red Lentil Curry (Dal)

A hearty, nutritious vegetarian curry packed with protein, fiber, and warming spices.

## Ingredients

### Curry Base

- 1.5 cups red lentils (dry), rinsed well
- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (14 oz) light coconut milk
- 2 cups vegetable broth or water

### Spices

- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1.5 tsp cumin
- 1.5 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt & Black Pepper

### Vegetables

- 2 cups kale, stems removed and roughly chopped
- 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and diced into 0.5 inch cubes

### To Serve

- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 0.5 lemon or lime

**Prep Notes:**

- Red lentils cook much faster than other lentil varieties (about 15-20 minutes).
- Rinse lentils well to remove excess starch.
- Dice sweet potato small so it cooks at the same rate as the lentils.
- Remove tough stems from kale before chopping.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Sauté Aromatics**:
   - Heat avocado oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
   - Add onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until softened.
   - Add garlic and ginger. Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

2. **Toast Spices**:
   - Add curry powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala.
   - Stir constantly for 30-60 seconds until very fragrant.

3. **Build the Curry**:
   - Add diced tomatoes, coconut milk, and vegetable broth.
   - Add rinsed red lentils and diced sweet potato.
   - Season with salt and pepper.
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.

4. **Simmer**:
   - Simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils and sweet potato are tender.
   - The curry will thicken as it cooks. Add more broth or water if it gets too thick.

5. **Finish**:
   - Stir in kale and cook until wilted and tender (about 3-4 minutes).
   - Squeeze in lemon or lime juice.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or more lemon juice.

6. **Serve**:
   - Ladle into bowls.
   - Top with fresh cilantro.
   - Serve as a hearty stew on its own.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Red lentils are high in protein (about 18g per cup cooked), fiber, iron, and folate. Sweet potato adds vitamin A and complex carbs. Kale provides vitamins K, A, and C.
- **Meal Prep**: This curry keeps well in the fridge for 4-5 days and freezes beautifully.
- **Serving Size**: This makes about 6 servings, so you'll have leftovers for lunch or can halve the recipe.
- **Low Carb Option**: Eating as a stew without rice or bread keeps it lower in carbs while still being filling and satisfying.
- **Vegetables**: Feel free to add more vegetables like cauliflower, bell peppers, or carrots for extra volume and nutrients.
