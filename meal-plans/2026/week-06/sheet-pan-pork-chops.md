Bone-in pork chops with a sweet fig and honey spread, roasted alongside seasoned vegetables.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 2 bone-in pork chops (about 1 inch thick)
- 3-4 tbsp fig and honey spread (from jar)
- Salt & Black Pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme
- 0.5 tsp smoked paprika

### Vegetables

- 1 small butternut squash (about 2 lb), peeled and cubed into 0.75 inch pieces
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 0.5 inch rounds
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 1 red onion, cut into wedges
- 2.5 tbsp olive oil
- Salt & Black Pepper
- 1.5 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- 0.25 tsp cinnamon (adds warmth with the butternut squash)

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut butternut squash and carrots into uniform pieces so they cook evenly.
- Pat pork chops dry before seasoning to get good browning.
- Line sheet pan with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Season and Start Vegetables**:
   - In a large bowl, toss butternut squash, carrots, cauliflower, and red onion with 2.5 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and cinnamon.
   - Spread on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
   - Roast for 15 minutes.

3. **Add Pork Chops**:
   - Remove pan from oven. Push vegetables to the sides and place pork chops in the center.
   - Brush pork chops with olive oil on both sides and season generously with salt, pepper, thyme, and smoked paprika.
   - Spread half of the fig and honey spread on top of each pork chop.

4. **Finish Roasting**:
   - Return to oven and roast for 15-18 minutes until pork chops reach 145°F internal temperature.
   - During the last 5 minutes, spread additional fig and honey spread on the pork chops if desired.
   - Let pork chops rest for 5 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- **Pre-made Spread**: Using jarred fig and honey spread makes this quick and easy.
- **Doneness**: Pork is safe to eat at 145°F and will be slightly pink in the center. Don't overcook or it will be dry.
- **Flavor Pairing**: The sweet fig and honey pairs beautifully with the warm spices on the vegetables.
- The cinnamon adds a subtle warmth that complements both the pork and butternut squash.
