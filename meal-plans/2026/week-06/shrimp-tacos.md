- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

### Tacos

### Pineapple-Cilantro Slaw

- 0.5 small head green cabbage, thinly sliced (about 3 cups) - save other half for stir fry

### Toppings

- Pickled red onions (from jar)

- 1-2 tsp chipotle powder or hot sauce (mixed into Greek yogurt)
- 1 tsp lime juice (mixed into crema)
- Lime wedges
- [Optional] Fresh cilantro, crumbled queso fresco or cotija cheese

**Prep Notes:**

- Pat shrimp very dry before seasoning so they sear properly instead of steaming.
- Make the slaw at least 15-30 minutes ahead so flavors can meld.
- Cut your own cabbage and carrots for the freshest slaw.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Make Pineapple-Cilantro Slaw**:
   - In a large bowl, combine sliced cabbage, julienned carrots, diced pineapple, and cilantro.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, lime juice, honey, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.
   - Pour dressing over slaw and toss well to coat everything.
   - Refrigerate for at least 15-30 minutes while preparing the rest.

2. **Make Chipotle-Lime Crema**:
   - In a small bowl, mix Greek yogurt with chipotle powder (or hot sauce) and lime juice.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning. It should be creamy, smoky, and tangy.
   - Set aside.

3. **Cook Shrimp**:
   - Pat shrimp very dry with paper towels.
   - In a bowl, toss shrimp with olive oil, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne (if using), minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
   - Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Add shrimp in a single layer (work in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding).
   - Cook 2-3 minutes per side until pink, opaque, and slightly charred.
   - Squeeze lime juice over shrimp in the last 30 seconds of cooking.

4. **Warm Tortillas**:
   - Heat tortillas in a dry skillet or directly over a gas flame for 30 seconds per side until lightly charred and pliable.

5. **Assemble Tacos**:
   - Place 3-4 shrimp in each tortilla.
   - Add a generous scoop of pineapple-cilantro slaw.
   - Add pickled red onions (drain first).
   - Top with avocado slices and a generous drizzle of chipotle-lime crema.
   - Add any additional toppings (cilantro, cheese).
   - Serve with lime wedges for extra squeeze.

## Notes

- **Pineapple Power**: Pineapple is easier to work with than mango (buy pre-cut chunks!) and adds bold sweet-tart flavor that balances the spicy shrimp and creamy slaw.
- **Pickled Onions**: Using jarred pickled red onions adds tangy, bright flavor and saves time.
- **Creamy & Flavorful**: With 0.5 cup yogurt in the slaw and 0.5 cup in the crema, these tacos are creamy and satisfying without being bland.
- **Cabbage Note**: Save the other half of the cabbage for the stir fry later in the week!
- **Low Carb**: Using low carb tortillas keeps the calorie count down while still enjoying tacos.
- **Protein**: Shrimp are high in protein and very low in fat.
- **Volume**: The slaw adds great crunch, sweetness, and volume to the tacos.
