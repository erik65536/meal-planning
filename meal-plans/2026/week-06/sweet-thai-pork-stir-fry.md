# Sweet Thai Pork Stir Fry

Quick and flavorful stir fry with pork, vegetables, and sweet Thai sauce over rice noodles.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 2 boneless pork chops (about 12 oz), cooked and cubed into bite-sized pieces
- 1 tbsp avocado oil or vegetable oil
- 0.5 small head green cabbage, thinly sliced (about 3 cups) - leftover from tacos
- 12 oz frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, snap peas, peppers)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, minced (or 0.5 tsp ground ginger)

### Sauce

- 1 jar sweet Thai chili stir fry sauce (8-10 oz, such as Thai Kitchen or similar)

### Noodles

- 8 oz rice noodles (pad Thai style)

**Prep Notes:**

- Cook and cube pork ahead of time for quick assembly.
- Use the other half of the cabbage from the shrimp tacos.
- Rice noodles can be soaked in hot water instead of boiled if desired - check package instructions.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prep Noodles**:
   - Cook rice noodles according to package directions.
   - Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Set aside.

2. **Stir Fry**:
   - Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.
   - Add sliced cabbage. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes until starting to soften and char slightly.
   - Add frozen vegetables. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until heated through and cabbage is tender-crisp.
   - Add garlic and ginger. Cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

3. **Combine**:
   - Add cooked pork cubes to the pan. Stir to combine.
   - Add the jar of sweet Thai stir fry sauce.
   - Add cooked rice noodles to the pan.
   - Toss everything together for 2-3 minutes until heated through and noodles are well coated.

4. **Serve**:
   - Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
   - [Optional] Top with sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, or fresh cilantro.

## Notes

- **Time Saver**: This meal comes together in about 15 minutes if the pork is pre-cooked.
- **Veggie Volume**: Fresh cabbage plus frozen veggie mix provides great volume for lower calories and excellent texture.
- **Cabbage Bonus**: Using the leftover cabbage from taco night means no waste and adds a nice crunch to the stir fry.
- **Sauce Variations**: If the jarred sauce is too sweet, add a splash of rice vinegar or lime juice to balance.
