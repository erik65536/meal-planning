Bold, flavorful salmon with roasted sweet potatoes and cherry tomatoes.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 1 large salmon fillet (approximately 1.5 lb)
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- Salt & Black Pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp coriander
- 0.25 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped (or 1 tbsp dried)
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges for serving

### Vegetables

- 3 medium sweet potatoes, diced into 0.5 inch cubes
- 2 pints cherry tomatoes
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt & Black Pepper
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp onion powder
- 0.25 tsp red pepper flakes

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut sweet potatoes small (0.5 inch) so they cook at the same rate as the tomatoes.
- Dry the salmon well before oiling to ensure nice browning.
- Line sheet pan with parchment paper for easiest cleanup.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Season Vegetables**:
   - In a large bowl, toss sweet potato cubes with 1.5 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes.
   - Spread on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
   - Roast for 15 minutes.

3. **Prepare Salmon Seasoning**:
   - While sweet potatoes roast, mix together minced garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, cayenne (if using), lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.

4. **Add Salmon and Tomatoes**:
   - Remove pan from oven. Push sweet potatoes to the sides.
   - Place salmon fillet in the center. Rub with 1 tbsp olive oil, then spread the spice mixture all over the top and sides of the salmon.
   - Toss cherry tomatoes with remaining 0.5 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Scatter around the salmon.

5. **Finish Roasting**:
   - Return to oven and roast for 12-15 minutes until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily.
   - Remove from oven. Sprinkle fresh dill and parsley over everything.
   - Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over the dish.

## Notes

- **Flavor Layers**: The spice rub on the salmon provides warmth and complexity, while the fresh herbs and lemon add brightness.
- **Nutrient Boost**: Cherry tomatoes release lycopene when roasted. Salmon provides omega-3 fatty acids.
- Salmon is done when it reaches 145°F internal temperature or flakes easily with a fork.
