# Air Fryer Breaded Salmon with Sides

Quick and easy pre-breaded salmon fillets with roasted potatoes and broccoli.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 2 pre-breaded, pre-seasoned salmon fillets (frozen or fresh)
- Cooking spray

### Sides

#### Roasted Baby Potatoes

- 1.5 lb baby potatoes (red or gold), halved
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp dried rosemary
- 0.5 tsp onion powder
- Salt & Black Pepper

#### Roasted Broccoli

- 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.25 tsp red pepper flakes
- Salt & Black Pepper
- Lemon wedges for serving

**Prep Notes:**

- Halve baby potatoes for faster, even cooking.
- If using frozen salmon, no need to thaw - cook directly from frozen per package instructions.
- Both vegetables roast in the oven while salmon cooks in the air fryer.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**: 425°F (220°C).

2. **Start Potatoes**:
   - Toss halved baby potatoes with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, rosemary, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
   - Spread on a baking sheet in a single layer.
   - Roast for 20 minutes.

3. **Add Broccoli**:
   - While potatoes roast, toss broccoli florets with olive oil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
   - After potatoes have roasted for 20 minutes, remove pan and add broccoli to the same pan (or use a second pan if needed).
   - Return to oven and roast both for another 15-18 minutes until potatoes are golden and crispy and broccoli is tender with crispy edges.

4. **Cook Salmon** (Air Fryer):
   - While vegetables finish roasting, spray air fryer basket with cooking spray.
   - Place salmon fillets in basket, not touching.
   - Cook at 390°F for 10-12 minutes (frozen: 12-14 minutes) until golden brown and cooked through.
   - Check package instructions for specific timing.

5. **Serve**:
   - Plate salmon with roasted potatoes and broccoli.
   - Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over everything.

## Notes

- **Timing**: Start potatoes first, add broccoli after 20 minutes, then start salmon so everything finishes around the same time.
- **Crispiness**: Don't overcrowd pans - vegetables need space to roast and crisp up.
- If you don't have an air fryer, bake salmon at 400°F for 12-15 minutes until golden and cooked through.
