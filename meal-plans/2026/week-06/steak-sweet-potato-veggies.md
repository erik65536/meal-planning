# Steak, Sweet Potato, & Veggie

A balanced plate featuring quality protein, complex carbs, and vegetables.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 2 sirloin steaks (or ribeye)
- 2 tbsp avocado oil, divided
- Salt & Black Pepper (coarse ground)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped (or 0.5 tsp dried)
- 1 tsp fresh thyme, chopped (or 0.5 tsp dried)
- 0.5 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.25 tsp garlic powder

### Starch

- 2 sweet potatoes, scrubbed clean
- [Optional] Greek yogurt for topping

### Vegetable

- 16 oz frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn, green beans)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter
- Lemon juice for finishing

**Prep Notes:**

- Let steaks come to room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking for even doneness.
- Wash potatoes thoroughly; eat the skin for extra fiber.

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Sweet Potatoes**:
   - Poke holes all over potatoes with a fork.
   - Wrap each potato in aluminum foil.
   - Microwave for 5-7 minutes until starting to soften.
   - Unwrap and transfer to a 400°F oven for 15-20 minutes to finish cooking and crisp the skin.

2. **Steak**:
   - Pat steaks dry. Season generously on both sides with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and garlic powder.
   - Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat with 1 tbsp avocado oil.
   - Sear steaks 3-4 minutes per side (depending on thickness and preference for doneness).
   - During the last minute, add remaining 1 tbsp avocado oil, garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the pan. Spoon the garlic herb oil over the steaks while they finish.
   - Let rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.

3. **Veggies**:
   - While steak rests, add frozen vegetable mix to a pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add olive oil or butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and any excess moisture evaporates (about 5-7 minutes).
   - Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Sweet potatoes are lower glycemic and high in Vitamin A compared to russets.
- **Healthy Fats**: Use avocado oil for high-heat searing to avoid oxidizing the oil.
