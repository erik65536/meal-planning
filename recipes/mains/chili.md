# Chili

A robust, bean-heavy chili packed with fiber and protein.

## Ingredients

### The Meat (Optional)

- 8 oz ground beef (lean) or ground turkey
- [Vegetarian]: Skip meat and add an extra can of beans or lentils

### The Beans & Veg

- 2 x 15 oz cans bean mix (kidney, pinto, black beans), drained and rinsed
- 15 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 15 oz can diced tomatoes
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced (optional)
- 2 packets sodium-free beef bouillon powder

### The Spices

- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp Mexican oregano
- [Optional] 1-2 tsp cocoa powder (adds depth)
- [Optional] 1 tsp cinnamon (Cincinnati style hint)

### Toppings

- Greek yogurt (sour cream sub)
- Green onions, sliced
- Avocado chunks
- Cheese

**Prep Notes:**

- Rinsing canned beans removes excess sodium and starch.
- This recipe scales very well; make a double batch and freeze portions.

**Variations:**

- **Spicy**: Add cayenne pepper or diced jalapeños.
- **Veggie Loaded**: Add diced zucchini, sweet potato, or carrots to the base.
- **Pumpkin Chili**: Stir in 1/2 cup pumpkin puree for a creamy texture and nutrient boost.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Brown Meat**:
    -   In a large pot, brown the ground meat over medium-high heat. Drain fat.
    -   Add onion and peppers. Sauté until soft (5 mins).
2.  **Bloom Spices**:
    -   Add all spices to the pot. Stir constantly for 1 minute to release oils.
3.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, beans, and bouillon.
    -   Stir well. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
    -   Simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes to thicken and meld flavors.
4.  **Serve**: Ladle into bowls and add toppings.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Beans are excellent sources of fiber and plant protein. Tomatoes provide lycopene.
- **Sodium**: Using sodium-free bouillon allows you to salt to taste.
