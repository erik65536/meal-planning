# Lentil Shepherd's Pie with Cauliflower Mash

A healthier, vegetarian twist on classic shepherd's pie. Hearty brown lentils simmered with vegetables in savory gravy, topped with creamy cauliflower mash instead of traditional potatoes.

## Ingredients

### Lentil Filling

- 1.5 cups brown or green lentils, dry (NOT red lentils)
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried thyme (or 1 tbsp fresh)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 1 tbsp fresh)
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 cup frozen peas
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari (for umami)
- [Optional] 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (use vegan version if needed)
- [Optional] 8 oz mushrooms, diced

**Prep Notes:**

- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use red lentils - they turn mushy. Brown or green lentils hold their shape
- Rinse lentils and check for small stones
- No need to pre-soak lentils

**Variations:**

- **Protein Addition**: Add 1 lb cooked ground beef, turkey, or plant-based meat for extra heartiness
- **Bean Version**: Replace lentils with 2 cans mixed beans (kidney, black, pinto)
- **Mushroom-Heavy**: Use 1 lb mushrooms for meatier texture
- **French Lentils**: Use puy lentils (French green lentils) for firmer texture

### Cauliflower Mash Topping

- 1 large head cauliflower (about 2 lbs), cut into florets
- 1 tbsp butter or olive oil (use olive oil for vegan)
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 2 tbsp nutritional yeast (for cheesy flavor)
- [Optional] 2 tbsp milk or cream (or plant-based milk)
- [Optional] 0.25 cup grated Parmesan (omit for vegan)

**Prep Notes:**

- Steam cauliflower until VERY soft - this is key for smooth mash
- Drain well after steaming to avoid watery topping
- Food processor or immersion blender creates smoothest texture

**Variations:**

- **Half-and-Half**: Use half cauliflower, half potatoes for compromise between traditional and low-carb
- **Sweet Potato**: Use mashed sweet potato instead of cauliflower
- **Butternut Squash**: Use mashed butternut squash for sweeter option
- **Traditional Potato**: Use 2 lbs mashed potatoes if not concerned about carbs
- **Celeriac Mash**: Use celery root (celeriac) for earthy flavor

## Seasoning Variations

### Traditional Herb Blend (Default)

- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 1 bay leaf

### Mediterranean Style

- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp basil
- 0.5 tsp fennel seeds
- Add 0.5 cup sun-dried tomatoes to filling

### Indian-Spiced

- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- Add 0.5 cup coconut milk to filling

### Smoky Style

- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 0.5 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Cook Lentils**:
   - Heat oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat
   - Add onion, carrots, and celery; sauté 5-7 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic, cook 1 minute
   - Stir in tomato paste, cook 2 minutes
   - Add lentils, vegetable broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf
   - Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer
   - Cook uncovered 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but still hold shape
   - Most liquid should be absorbed (if too wet, simmer longer; if too dry, add splash of broth)
   - Stir in frozen peas (they'll cook from residual heat)
   - Remove bay leaf
   - Season with salt, pepper, and optional soy sauce/Worcestershire

2. **Make Cauliflower Mash**:
   - While lentils cook, bring large pot of water to boil
   - Add cauliflower florets, steam or boil 10-12 minutes until very tender (knife should slide through easily)
   - Drain thoroughly and let steam off for 2-3 minutes
   - Transfer to food processor (or use immersion blender in pot)
   - Add butter/oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
   - Blend until smooth and creamy
   - Taste and adjust seasoning

3. **Assemble**:
   - Preheat oven to 375°F (convection bake preferred)
   - Spread lentil filling evenly in a 9x13 inch baking dish (or similar 2.5-3 qt casserole)
   - Dollop cauliflower mash over filling
   - Gently spread with spatula to cover completely, creating an even layer
   - Optional: Use fork to create ridges on surface (helps with browning)
   - Optional: Drizzle with melted butter or olive oil

4. **Bake**:
   - Bake 20 minutes until filling is bubbling at edges
   - If top isn't golden, turn on broiler to high
   - Broil 2-3 minutes, watching closely, until peaks of mash are golden brown
   - Be careful not to burn

5. **Rest & Serve**:
   - Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving (allows filling to set)
   - Scoop portions onto plates

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Individual Ramekins**: Divide filling among 6 oven-safe ramekins, top with mash, bake at 375°F for 15-20 minutes. Great for portion control and meal prep.

**Make-Ahead**: Assemble completely, cover, and refrigerate up to 2 days. Bake from cold, adding 10-15 minutes to baking time.

**Freezer-Friendly**: Assemble in disposable aluminum pan, cover tightly, freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge, then bake as directed.

## Topping Variations

- **Cheese**: Sprinkle 0.5 cup shredded cheddar or gruyere on mash before baking
- **Herbed Breadcrumbs**: Mix 0.5 cup panko with 1 tbsp melted butter and 1 tsp Italian herbs, sprinkle over mash
- **Seeds**: Top with sunflower or pumpkin seeds for crunch

## Notes

- This is lighter than traditional shepherd's pie but equally satisfying
- Cauliflower mash has about 80% fewer carbs than potato
- High in protein (lentils) and fiber (lentils + cauliflower)
- Fully vegetarian and easily made vegan
- Leftovers reheat beautifully in microwave or oven
- The filling can also be used as a hearty soup (add more broth) or served over rice/pasta
- If you've never tried cauliflower mash, this is a great introduction - the savory lentil filling pairs perfectly
