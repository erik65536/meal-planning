# Veggie Jambalaya

A Creole-inspired one-pot meal packed with vegetables and bold spices. Uses cauliflower rice for a lighter base.

## Ingredients

### The Holy Trinity (+ Extras)
- 1 Onion, diced
- 2 Bell Peppers (Green and Red), diced
- 2 stalks Celery, diced
- 1 cup Okra, sliced (frozen or fresh) or Green Beans
- 1 can (15 oz) Diced Tomatoes (fire roasted is best)

### The Base
- 1 head Cauliflower, riced (or 1 bag frozen cauliflower rice)
- [Optional] 0.5 cup Brown Rice (cooked separately) to mix in for texture

### Protein (Choose One)
- 1 lb Shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 lb Chicken Breast/Thighs, diced
- 12 oz Andouille Sausage (or any smoked sausage), sliced

### Cajun Seasoning Blend
- 1 tbsp Paprika (Smoked or Sweet)
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp Onion Powder
- 1 tsp Oregano
- 1 tsp Thyme
- 0.5 tsp Cayenne Pepper (adjust for heat)
- 1 tbsp Tomato Paste

**Prep Notes:**
- "Mise en place" is key here: chop all your veggies (Trinity) before you turn on the heat.
- If using frozen cauliflower rice, do not thaw it beforehand; add it frozen to prevent mushiness.

**Variations:**
- **Vegan**: Use kidney beans instead of meat and use vegetable broth/bouillon.
- **Seafood**: Add white fish chunks in the last 5 minutes.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sear Protein**:
    -   Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large pot/Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
    -   Add chicken or sausage. Brown nicely. Remove and set aside.
    -   *If using Shrimp*: Sear quickly (1-2 mins) and remove.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics**:
    -   Add onion, peppers, and celery to the pot. Cook 5-7 mins until soft.
    -   Stir in tomato paste and spice blend. Cook 1 min to bloom spices.
3.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add diced tomatoes (with juices) and okra/green beans.
    -   Stir in 0.5 cup broth or water if it looks too dry.
    -   Simmer 5-10 mins to blend flavors.
4.  **The "Rice"**:
    -   Stir in the cauliflower rice.
    -   Return chicken/sausage to the pot.
    -   Cover and cook 5-7 mins until cauliflower is tender but not mushy.
    -   *If using Shrimp*: Stir them in now and cook 2 mins to warm through.
5.  **Finish**:
    -   Taste for salt and heat.
    -   Serve topped with sliced green onions.

## Notes
- **Nutrient Boost**: Cauliflower rice drastically reduces calories while increasing fiber and Vitamin C compared to white rice.
- **Sodium**: Use low-sodium canned tomatoes and make your own spice blend (as listed) to control salt.
