# Creamy Yogurt Stroganoff

A lighter, nutrient-dense take on the classic comfort food. This version swaps heavy cream for a savory Greek yogurt and nutritional yeast sauce, packed with mushrooms and greens.

## Ingredients

### Base & Veggies
- 1 lb Mushrooms (Cremini or White), sliced thick
- 1 large Onion, diced
- 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- 2 cups Spinach or Kale, chopped (add at the end)
- [Optional] 1 Zucchini, diced (for extra bulk)
- 1 tbsp Avocado oil or Olive oil

### Protein (Choose One)
- **Beef**: 1 lb Sirloin or Flank steak, sliced into thin strips against the grain.
- **Ground**: 1 lb Lean Ground Beef or Turkey.
- **Vegetarian**: 1.5 cups Brown Lentils (cooked) or extra mushrooms/tofu.

### The Sauce
- 1.5 cups Beef or Vegetable Broth (Low Sodium)
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (use vegetarian version if needed)
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp Nutritional Yeast (for savory depth)
- 0.5 cup Plain Greek Yogurt (stirred in at the end)
- 1 tbsp Cornstarch (mixed with splash of water) or Arrowroot powder
- 1 tsp Dried Thyme
- Salt & Black Pepper to taste

### Serving
- 6-8 oz Egg Noodles, Whole Wheat Pasta, or Protein Pasta
- Fresh Parsley, chopped

**Prep Notes:**
- Slice the mushrooms evenly so they brown rather than steam.
- Bring the Greek yogurt to room temperature to prevent curdling when added to the hot sauce.

**Variations:**
- **Extra Umami**: Add a splash of soy sauce or dried mushroom powder to the broth.
- **Gluten Free**: Use GF pasta or serve over mashed cauliflower/potatoes.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Cook Pasta**: Boil pasta in salted water according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2.  **Sear Protein**:
    -   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
    -   Add beef strips (in batches if needed) or ground meat. Season with salt/pepper.
    -   Cook until browned but not fully done. Remove and set aside.
    -   *If using Lentils*: Skip this step and add them later.
3.  **Cook Veggies**:
    -   In the same pan, add mushrooms. Cook undisturbed for 3-4 mins to brown.
    -   Add onions (and zucchini if using). Sauté 5 mins until soft.
    -   Add garlic and thyme; cook 1 min.
4.  **Make Sauce**:
    -   Pour in broth, deglazing the pan (scrape up bits).
    -   Stir in Worcestershire, Dijon, and nutritional yeast.
    -   Return protein to the pan (or add lentils). Simmer 5 mins.
    -   Stir in cornstarch slurry. Simmer 1 min until thickened.
5.  **Finish**:
    -   Remove from heat (Important!). Let cool for 1 minute.
    -   Stir in spinach/kale to wilt.
    -   Stir in Greek Yogurt until creamy. Do not boil again.
    -   Toss with pasta and garnish with parsley.

## Notes
- **Technique**: Adding yogurt to boiling liquid will cause it to split. Always remove from heat first.
- **Nutrition**: Nutritional yeast adds B-vitamins and a cheesy/nutty flavor without dairy fat.
