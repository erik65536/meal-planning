# Savory Crepes (Winter Florentine)

Delicate, thin French crepes filled with a savory mixture of mushrooms, spinach, and chicken, topped with melted Swiss or Gruyère cheese. Served with roasted broccoli.

## Ingredients

### Crepe Batter

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 0.5 cup milk (whole or 2%)
- 0.5 cup water
- 2 tbsp melted butter (plus more for cooking)
- 0.25 tsp salt
- [Optional] 1 tbsp fresh herbs (chives, parsley, or thyme)

**Prep Notes:**

- **CRUCIAL**: Let batter rest 30 minutes at room temperature (or refrigerate overnight) for best texture
- Batter should be thin, like heavy cream consistency
- Blend in a blender for smoothest results, or whisk vigorously

**Variations:**

- **Buckwheat Crepes**: Replace half the all-purpose flour with buckwheat flour for traditional Breton-style crepes
- **Whole Wheat**: Use half whole wheat flour for more fiber
- **Gluten-Free**: Use gluten-free 1:1 flour blend (add 1 tsp xanthan gum if blend doesn't include it)

### Savory Filling

- 8 oz mushrooms (cremini, button, or mixed), sliced
- 2 cups fresh spinach (or 1 cup frozen, thawed and squeezed dry)
- 1 cup cooked chicken, shredded (rotisserie chicken works great)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp butter or olive oil
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 0.25 cup white wine or chicken broth
- [Optional] 2 tbsp heavy cream or cream cheese
- [Optional] Pinch of nutmeg

**Prep Notes:**

- Sauté mushrooms until they release moisture and it evaporates (critical for non-watery filling)
- If using frozen spinach, squeeze out ALL water in a towel

**Variations:**

- **Ham & Cheese**: Replace chicken with diced ham, omit mushrooms
- **Vegetarian**: Skip chicken, double the mushrooms, add 0.5 cup ricotta cheese
- **Seafood**: Replace chicken with cooked shrimp or crab
- **Ratatouille**: Fill with roasted zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers
- **Breakfast Style**: Fill with scrambled eggs, sausage, and cheese

### Cheese

- 4-6 slices Swiss cheese or Gruyère
- [Optional] 0.25 cup grated Parmesan

**Variations:**

- **Cheddar**: Use sharp white cheddar for a different flavor profile
- **Goat Cheese**: Crumble goat cheese for a tangy option
- **Vegan**: Use plant-based cheese slices

### Roasted Broccoli Side

- 1 large crown broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [Optional] Lemon wedges
- [Optional] Red pepper flakes

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut florets into similar sizes for even roasting
- Toss stems with florets (peel tough outer layer and slice stems)

**Variations:**

- **Parmesan Roasted**: Toss with grated Parmesan in last 5 minutes
- **Asian Style**: Toss with sesame oil and soy sauce instead of olive oil and salt
- **Broccolini**: Use broccolini instead of regular broccoli

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Make Crepe Batter**:
   - Combine flour, eggs, milk, water, melted butter, and salt in a blender
   - Blend until completely smooth, about 30 seconds
   - Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes (or refrigerate overnight)
   - Stir before using

2. **Roast Broccoli**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast preferred)
   - Toss broccoli florets with oil, salt, and pepper on a sheet pan
   - Roast 15-20 minutes until edges are crispy and slightly charred
   - Set aside and keep warm

3. **Cook Filling**:
   - Heat butter in large skillet over medium-high heat
   - Add mushrooms and cook 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and liquid has evaporated
   - Add garlic, cook 30 seconds
   - Add spinach and cook until wilted (1-2 minutes for fresh, just heated through for frozen)
   - Stir in cooked chicken, salt, pepper, and optional cream/wine
   - Remove from heat and keep warm

4. **Cook Crepes**:
   - Heat an 8-10 inch non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat
   - Lightly butter the pan
   - Pour about 1/4 cup batter into pan, immediately tilt and swirl to spread thinly across bottom
   - Cook 1-2 minutes until edges begin to lift and bottom is lightly golden
   - Flip with spatula (or if confident, flip by tossing pan)
   - Cook other side 30-60 seconds
   - Slide onto plate
   - Repeat with remaining batter, stacking crepes (they won't stick)

5. **Assemble & Melt**:
   - Return empty skillet to low-medium heat
   - Place one cooked crepe back in pan
   - On one half of the crepe, add: 1 slice cheese, generous spoonful of filling
   - Fold crepe in half, then in half again (creating a triangle/wedge shape)
   - Heat 1-2 minutes until cheese melts and crepe is warmed through
   - Slide onto plate
   - Repeat with remaining crepes

6. **Serve**: Serve 2-3 crepes per person with roasted broccoli on the side

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Baked Assembly**: Make all crepes ahead. Fill and fold, place in a buttered baking dish. Top with cream sauce or extra cheese. Bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes until heated through and bubbly.

**Make-Ahead**: Cook all crepes in advance (they keep refrigerated 3 days or frozen 2 months with parchment between each). When ready to serve, fill and heat as directed.

**Griddle Method**: Use an electric griddle or large griddle pan to cook multiple crepes simultaneously.

## Notes

- First crepe is often a "test" crepe - don't worry if it's imperfect
- Resting the batter allows flour to fully hydrate, resulting in tender crepes
- Crepes should be very thin - you should almost be able to see through them
- Use a small ladle or 1/4 cup measure for consistent crepe sizes
- A good non-stick pan is essential - traditional crepe pans have low edges for easy flipping
- Savory crepes are called "galettes" in Brittany when made with buckwheat flour
