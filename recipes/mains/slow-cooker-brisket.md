# Slow Cooker Brisket (One Pot)

A complete one-pot meal with tender, fall-apart beef brisket cooked low and slow with potatoes, carrots, and onions in a savory broth. Minimal prep, maximum comfort.

## Ingredients

### Brisket

- 3-4 lb beef brisket (flat cut preferred)
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp paprika
- 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- [Optional] 1 tbsp olive oil (for searing)

**Prep Notes:**

- Flat cut is leaner and more uniform than point cut
- Trim excess fat cap to about 1/4 inch (some fat adds flavor)
- Can be cooked from refrigerator-cold (no need to bring to room temp)

**Variations:**

- **Chuck Roast**: Use a 3-4 lb chuck roast for a more marbled, economical option
- **Short Ribs**: Use 3-4 lbs bone-in beef short ribs (reduce cooking time to 6-7 hours)
- **Corned Beef**: Use corned beef brisket with included spice packet for a Reuben-style dinner

### Vegetables

- 4-5 large red potatoes or Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 medium onions, cut into thick slices or wedges
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed or minced
- [Optional] 2 celery stalks, cut into 2-inch pieces
- [Optional] 1 parsnip, cut into chunks

**Prep Notes:**

- **IMPORTANT**: Use waxy potatoes (red or Yukon gold) - they hold their shape during long cooking. Russets will fall apart
- Cut vegetables large (2 inches) so they don't turn to mush
- Layer vegetables on bottom; they'll cushion meat and absorb flavors

**Variations:**

- **Root Veggie Mix**: Add turnips, rutabaga, or parsnips
- **Cabbage Addition**: Add cabbage wedges in the last 2 hours of cooking
- **Minimal Veg**: Skip potatoes and serve brisket with crusty bread or mashed potatoes made separately

### Braising Liquid & Seasonings

- 1 cup beef broth (or stock)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 bay leaf
- [Optional] 0.5 cup red wine
- [Optional] 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- [Optional] 1 tsp brown sugar
- [Optional] 1 tsp Dijon mustard

**Prep Notes:**

- Whisk tomato paste into broth to prevent lumps
- Don't add too much liquid - brisket and vegetables release moisture as they cook

**Variations:**

- **BBQ Style**: Replace broth with 1 cup BBQ sauce + 0.5 cup water
- **French-Inspired**: Use red wine, add herbes de Provence
- **Guinness Braised**: Replace broth with 1 cup Guinness beer
- **Asian-Inspired**: Use beef broth + 2 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp hoisin + ginger

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Optional Searing** (Recommended but not required):
   - Season brisket all over with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder
   - Heat oil in large skillet over high heat
   - Sear brisket 3-4 minutes per side until deep brown crust forms
   - This adds flavor but can be skipped if short on time

2. **Layer Slow Cooker**:
   - Place potatoes, carrots, onions, and celery (if using) in bottom of slow cooker
   - Nestle garlic cloves among vegetables
   - Place brisket on top of vegetables (fat side up if there's a fat cap)
   - Add thyme sprigs and bay leaf

3. **Add Liquid**:
   - In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk together beef broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and any optional ingredients (wine, vinegar, etc.)
   - Pour mixture over and around brisket (don't pour directly onto meat top)

4. **Slow Cook**:
   - Cover and cook on LOW for 8-9 hours
   - Brisket is done when fork-tender and shreds easily
   - Don't lift lid during cooking (releases heat and adds 20-30 minutes to cook time)

5. **Rest & Serve**:
   - Transfer brisket to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes
   - Slice against the grain into 1/4-1/2 inch slices (or shred with forks)
   - Use slotted spoon to remove vegetables to serving platter
   - Remove bay leaf and thyme stems from cooking liquid
   - Optional: Skim fat from surface of liquid with spoon or pour through fat separator

6. **Serve**:
   - Arrange sliced brisket and vegetables on plates
   - Ladle cooking liquid over everything as a gravy
   - Season with additional salt and pepper to taste

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Oven Braising**: Sear brisket in oven-safe Dutch oven. Add vegetables and liquid. Cover tightly with lid or foil. Braise at 300°F for 3.5-4 hours until tender.

**Instant Pot**: Sear using Sauté function. Add vegetables and liquid. Pressure cook on high 60-75 minutes (for 3-4 lb brisket). Natural release 15 minutes.

**Stovetop**: Sear in large pot or Dutch oven. Add vegetables and liquid. Bring to simmer, reduce to lowest heat, cover, and simmer 3-4 hours until tender.

## Gravy Enhancement (Optional)

If you want thicker gravy:

1. **Cornstarch Slurry**: Mix 2 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp cold water. Stir into cooking liquid, simmer 2-3 minutes until thickened.

2. **Reduction**: Transfer cooking liquid to saucepan, simmer 10-15 minutes to reduce and concentrate flavors.

3. **Roux**: In a small pan, melt 2 tbsp butter, whisk in 2 tbsp flour, cook 1 minute, then whisk into cooking liquid.

## Notes

- This is an ideal "set it and forget it" meal for busy days
- Brisket actually benefits from long, slow cooking - it becomes more tender
- Leftovers are excellent: Use for sandwiches, tacos, hash, or shepherd's pie
- Brisket can be made 1-2 days ahead; it actually tastes better after resting overnight (flavors meld)
- To reheat: Slice cold brisket, place in baking dish with reserved liquid, cover, and heat at 325°F for 30 minutes
- One pot means minimal cleanup - just the slow cooker insert to wash
