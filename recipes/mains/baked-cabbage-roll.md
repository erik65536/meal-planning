# Baked Cabbage Rolls

Tender cabbage leaves wrapped around a savory meat and rice filling, baked in tomato sauce.

## Ingredients

### Wrapper

- 1 large head green cabbage
- Water for boiling

### Filling

- 1 lb ground beef, pork, or turkey
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 egg (binder)
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp pepper
- 1 tbsp fresh mint, chopped (or 1 tsp dried) - *Key flavor!*
- [Optional] 1 tsp paprika

### Sauce

- 15 oz tomato sauce or marinara
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp brown sugar or honey (for sweet/sour balance)
- [Optional] 14 oz can sauerkraut (rinsed) spread on bottom of dish for extra tang

**Prep Notes:**

- **Freezing Cabbage Trick**: Instead of boiling, freeze the whole head of cabbage overnight, then thaw. The leaves will be pliable without cooking!
- **Lazy Version**: Chop the cabbage and layer it with the filling in a casserole dish (Cabbage Roll Casserole). No rolling required.

**Variations:**

- **Vegetarian**: Use lentils, mushrooms, and walnuts instead of meat.
- **Grain Free**: Use cauliflower rice instead of white rice.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Prep Cabbage**:
    -   Boil a large pot of salted water. Remove core from cabbage.
    -   Boil whole head for 3-5 minutes until outer leaves peel off easily. Peel off 12-14 leaves.
    -   Shave down the thick vein on the back of each leaf so it rolls easier.
2.  **Make Filling**:
    -   Mix meat, rice, onion, garlic, egg, mint, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Do not overwork.
3.  **Roll**:
    -   Place ~1/4 cup filling at the stem end of a leaf.
    -   Fold sides in, then roll up tight like a burrito.
4.  **Assemble**:
    -   Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    -   Spread a little sauce (or sauerkraut) on bottom of a baking dish.
    -   Place rolls seam-side down, packed closely.
    -   Pour remaining sauce over the rolls.
5.  **Bake**:
    -   Cover tightly with foil.
    -   Bake 60-75 minutes until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Cabbage is high in Vitamin C and K.
- **Flavor Profile**: The mint adds a brightness that cuts through the rich tomato and meat flavors.
