# Black Bean Soup

A velvety, spicy soup that uses pantry staples to create a flavor explosion.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced (red or green)
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced (optional)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced

### Beans & Broth

- 3 x 15 oz cans black beans
    - *Method*: Drain and rinse 2 cans. Keep the liquid in the 3rd can (starch thickens soup).
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- [Optional] 14 oz can roasted tomatoes

### Spices

- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp oregano

### Novel Variations (Choose One path)

- **Cuban Style**: Add 1/2 cup orange juice and 1 tbsp sherry vinegar at the end.
- **Pumpkin Black Bean**: Stir in 1 cup pumpkin puree for a creamy, earthy fall version.
- **Chipotle**: Add 1-2 chipotles in adobo for a smoky heat.

### Toppings

- Greek yogurt
- Cilantro
- Avocado
- Lime wedges
- Tortilla strips

**Prep Notes:**

- This soup relies on blending part of the mixture to get that creamy restaurant-style texture without cream.

**Variations:**

- **Meaty**: Add leftover ham bone or diced bacon at the start.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sauté**:
    -   Heat oil in a pot.
    -   Add onion, peppers, and jalapeño. Sauté 5-8 minutes until soft.
    -   Add garlic and spices. Cook 1 minute.
2.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add beans (rinsed + unrinsed), broth, and tomatoes/pumpkin (if using).
    -   Bring to boil, reduce to simmer. Cook 15 minutes.
3.  **Blend**:
    -   Use an immersion blender to puree about half the soup (or transfer 2 cups to a blender). You want a mix of creamy liquid and whole beans.
4.  **Finish**:
    -   Stir in orange juice/vinegar (if doing Cuban style) or just a squeeze of lime.
    -   Serve hot with toppings.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: The dark color of black beans comes from anthocyanins, the same antioxidants found in blueberries.
