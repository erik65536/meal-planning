# Skillet Hash

A crispy, savory mix of diced root vegetables, greens, and protein. Perfect for breakfast or dinner.

## Ingredients

### The Roots (Base)
- 2 large Sweet Potatoes, peeled and diced small (1/2 inch cubes)
- [Optional] 1 Turnip or Rutabaga, diced (lower carb option)
- 1 Onion, chopped

### The Greens
- 4 cups Kale or Swiss Chard, stems removed and chopped
- [Optional] 1 cup Brussels Sprouts, shredded or halved

### Protein (Choose One)
- 1 lb Ground Sausage (Turkey or Pork)
- 1 lb Ground Turkey (season heavily with sage/thyme)
- 4-6 Eggs (cracked on top at the end)

### Seasoning
- 1 tsp Smoked Paprika
- 0.5 tsp Garlic Powder
- Salt & Pepper
- 1-2 tbsp Avocado Oil
- [Optional] Hot sauce for serving

**Prep Notes:**
- The key to a good hash is dicing the potatoes small enough so they cook through quickly and get crispy.
- If using eggs, you will steam them at the end.

**Variations:**
- **Apple & Sage**: Add a diced apple in the last 5 minutes of cooking for sweetness.
- **Chorizo**: Use chorizo spices (cumin, coriander, chili powder) and black beans.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Cook Meat (if using)**:
    -   Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
    -   Add sausage/turkey. Break apart and cook until browned. Remove and set aside.
    -   *If using Eggs*: Skip this step.
2.  **Crisp the Roots**:
    -   Add a bit more oil to the hot pan.
    -   Add sweet potatoes (and turnip/Brussels sprouts if using) and onion.
    -   Spread in a single layer. Let cook undisturbed for 3-4 mins to get a crust.
    -   Stir and repeat until potatoes are tender inside and crispy outside (10-15 mins).
    -   Add seasonings (paprika, salt, pepper).
3.  **Add Greens**:
    -   Stir in the chopped kale. Cook 2-3 mins until wilted.
    -   Return cooked meat to the pan and toss to combine.
4.  **Eggs (Optional)**:
    -   Make 4-6 small wells in the hash with a spoon.
    -   Crack an egg into each well.
    -   Cover the pan and cook on low for 5-7 mins until whites are set but yolks are runny.
5.  **Serve**: Immediately, with hot sauce or a dollop of yogurt.

## Notes
- **Nutrient Boost**: Sweet potatoes are high in Vitamin A. Kale provides Vitamin K and Calcium.
- **Leftovers**: Reheats well, but eggs are best cooked fresh.
