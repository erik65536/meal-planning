# Skillet Hash

A crispy, savory mix of diced root vegetables, greens, and protein. Perfect for breakfast or dinner.

## Ingredients

### The Roots (Base)

- 2 large Sweet Potatoes, peeled and diced small (1/2 inch cubes)
- [Optional] 1 Turnip or Rutabaga, diced (lower carb option)
- 1 Onion, chopped

### The Greens

- 4 cups Kale or Swiss Chard, stems removed and chopped
- [Optional] 1 cup Brussels Sprouts, shredded or halved

### Protein (Choose One)

- 1 lb Ground Sausage (Turkey or Pork)
- 1 lb Ground Turkey (season heavily with sage/thyme)
- 4-6 Eggs (cracked on top at the end)

### Seasoning

**Base Seasoning (Good Default):**

- 1 tsp Smoked Paprika
- 1 tsp Dried Thyme (or sage/rosemary)
- 0.5 tsp Garlic Powder (or 2-3 fresh cloves)
- 0.5 tsp Onion Powder (optional)
- 0.25 tsp Red Pepper Flakes (optional)
- Salt & Pepper
- 1-2 tbsp Avocado Oil

**Seasoning Ideas (Pick 1-2):**

- **Taco-ish**: 1 tsp cumin + 1 tsp chili powder
- **Mediterranean**: 1 tsp oregano + lemon juice at the end
- **Curry-ish**: 1 tsp curry powder + a pinch of turmeric
- **Everything Bagel**: sprinkle on top at the end
- **Umami Boost**: splash of soy sauce/tamari or Worcestershire
- **Bright Finish**: squeeze of lemon or lime

- [Optional] Hot sauce for serving

**Prep Notes:**

- The key to a good hash is dicing the potatoes small enough so they cook through quickly and get crispy.
- If using eggs, you will steam them at the end.

**Variations:**

- **Apple & Sage**: Add a diced apple in the last 5 minutes of cooking for sweetness.
- **Chorizo**: Use chorizo spices (cumin, coriander, chili powder) and black beans.
- **Tex-Mex**: Add cumin + chili powder, plus top with salsa and yogurt.
- **Mediterranean**: Add oregano + lemon, plus top with feta (or yogurt).

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Cook Meat (if using)**:
    - Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
    - Add sausage/turkey. Break apart and cook until browned. Remove and set aside.
    - _If using Eggs_: Skip this step.
2.  **Crisp the Roots**:
    - Add a bit more oil to the hot pan.
    - Add sweet potatoes (and turnip/Brussels sprouts if using) and onion.
    - Spread in a single layer. Let cook undisturbed for 3-4 mins to get a crust.
    - Stir and repeat until potatoes are tender inside and crispy outside (10-15 mins).
    - Add seasonings (paprika, salt, pepper).
3.  **Add Greens**:
    - Stir in the chopped kale. Cook 2-3 mins until wilted.
    - Return cooked meat to the pan and toss to combine.
4.  **Eggs (Optional)**:
    - Make 4-6 small wells in the hash with a spoon.
    - Crack an egg into each well.
    - Cover the pan and cook on low for 5-7 mins until whites are set but yolks are runny.
5.  **Serve**: Immediately, with hot sauce or a dollop of yogurt.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Sweet potatoes are high in Vitamin A. Kale provides Vitamin K and Calcium.
- **Leftovers**: Reheats well, but eggs are best cooked fresh.
