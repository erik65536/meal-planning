# Shakshouka

Eggs poached in a simmering, spicy tomato sauce. Great for any meal of the day.

## Ingredients

### Sauce Base

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp paprika (smoked or sweet)
- 0.5 tsp chili powder or cayenne (to taste)
- 1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce OR 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- [Optional] 8 oz ground beef/turkey (browned first)

### The Eggs & Greens

- 4-6 large eggs
- 4 cups kale or spinach, chopped
- [Optional] Feta cheese, crumbled
- Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped

### Serving

- Crusty bread, pita, or naan for dipping

**Prep Notes:**

- Use a wide skillet with a lid. You need surface area for the eggs.

**Variations:**

- **Green Shakshouka**: Use tomatillos, spinach, and herbs instead of tomatoes.
- **Meat Lovers**: Add spicy sausage (chorizo or merguez) to the base.
- **Bean Boost**: Add a can of chickpeas to the sauce for extra bulk and fiber.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Aromatics**:
    -   Heat oil in skillet. Sauté onion and pepper until soft (5-7 mins).
    -   Add garlic and spices. Cook 1 minute.
    -   (If using meat, brown it now before adding spices).
2.  **Sauce**:
    -   Pour in marinara/tomatoes.
    -   Stir in kale/spinach until wilted.
    -   Simmer for 5-10 minutes to thicken slightly.
3.  **Eggs**:
    -   Make small wells in the sauce with a spoon.
    -   Crack an egg into each well.
    -   Cover the pan. Simmer gently for 5-8 minutes until whites are set but yolks are still runny.
4.  **Finish**:
    -   Sprinkle with feta and herbs.
    -   Serve immediately from the pan.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Tomatoes cooked in oil (lycopene) + eggs (choline/protein) + greens (vitamins) make this a nutritional powerhouse.
- **Safety**: Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase risk of foodborne illness. Cook longer for firm yolks if preferred.
