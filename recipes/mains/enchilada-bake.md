# Enchilada Bake

A deconstructed enchilada casserole that layers ingredients like a lasagna. Easier to assemble than rolling individual tortillas.

## Ingredients

### Layers
- 6-8 Small Corn Tortillas or Low-Carb Tortillas, cut into strips or quarters
- 1.5 cups Enchilada Sauce (Red or Green - look for low sugar/sodium)
- 1 cup Shredded Cheese (Mexican blend or Cheddar) - use sparingly
- 0.5 cup Greek Yogurt (for topping)

### Filling Mixture
- 1 lb Protein (Ground Turkey, Shredded Chicken, or Black Beans/Lentils)
- 1 Onion, diced
- 1 Bell Pepper, diced
- 1 Zucchini, diced small
- 1 cup Corn (frozen or canned)
- 1 can (15 oz) Black Beans, rinsed (if not using as main protein)

### Seasoning
- 1 tbsp Chili Powder
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp Oregano

**Prep Notes:**
- Prepare the filling first on the stovetop to ensure veggies are tender before baking.
- Use a 9x9 or similar sized baking dish.

**Variations:**
- **Green Goddess**: Use salsa verde (green sauce), chicken, and spinach in the filling.
- **Vegetarian**: Skip meat and double the beans + add roasted sweet potato cubes.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish lightly.
2.  **Make Filling**:
    -   In a large skillet, brown the meat (if using) with the onion and pepper. Drain excess fat.
    -   Add zucchini, corn, beans, and seasonings. Cook 3-4 mins until zucchini softens slightly.
    -   Stir in 0.5 cup of the enchilada sauce into the meat/veggie mix.
3.  **Assemble**:
    -   Spread a thin layer of sauce on bottom of dish.
    -   **Layer 1**: Arrange 1/3 of tortilla pieces to cover bottom.
    -   **Layer 2**: Spread 1/2 of the filling mixture.
    -   **Layer 3**: Tortillas -> Sauce -> Remaining Filling -> Tortillas.
    -   **Top**: Pour remaining sauce over the top layer of tortillas. Sprinkle with cheese.
4.  **Bake**:
    -   Cover with foil and bake 20 mins.
    -   Remove foil and bake another 10-15 mins until bubbly and cheese is melted.
5.  **Serve**:
    -   Let cool 5-10 mins.
    -   Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt and fresh cilantro.

## Notes
- **Texture**: Cutting tortillas into strips ensures they soften evenly in the sauce.
- **Veggies**: This is a great "clean out the fridge" meal. Spinach, kale, or riced cauliflower can easily be hidden in the filling.
