# Moroccan Chickpea Stew

A fragrant, sweet, and savory stew loaded with plant protein and antioxidants.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 carrots, sliced rounds
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced

### Spices

- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp cinnamon (essential!)
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 0.5 tsp paprika
- 0.25 tsp cayenne (optional)

### Stew

- 2 x 15 oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 x 28 oz can crushed tomatoes OR 14 oz diced tomatoes + 1 cup broth
- 0.5 cup dried apricots or raisins (chopped)
- [Optional] 1 cup butternut squash, cubed

### Finish

- 2 cups spinach or kale
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Fresh cilantro
- [Optional] Toasted almonds or pistachios

**Prep Notes:**

- The dried fruit provides a traditional sweetness that balances the acidity of the tomatoes and warmth of the cinnamon.

**Variations:**

- **Protein Boost**: Add lentils or cubed chicken if you aren't keeping it vegetarian.
- **Grain**: Serve over couscous (traditional), quinoa (higher protein), or cauliflower rice.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sauté**:
    -   Heat oil in a large pot.
    -   Add onion, carrots, and peppers. Cook 5-7 minutes.
    -   Add garlic, ginger, and all spices. Cook 1 minute until fragrant.
2.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add chickpeas, tomatoes, broth (if using), apricots/raisins, and squash (if using).
    -   Bring to boil, cover, and reduce to low.
    -   Simmer 20 minutes until carrots/squash are tender.
3.  **Wilt Greens**:
    -   Stir in spinach/kale. Cook 2-3 minutes.
    -   Stir in lemon juice. Taste and salt as needed.
4.  **Serve**: Garnish with cilantro and nuts.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Chickpeas are high in fiber. Turmeric and ginger are anti-inflammatory. Vitamin C from lemon helps absorb plant iron.
