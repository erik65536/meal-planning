# Stuffed Squash

Roasted winter squash filled with a warm, sweet-and-savory mixture.

## Ingredients

### Squash Base

- 2 acorn squash or 1 large butternut squash
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for brushing)

### Filling

- 1 lb chicken sausage (apple or sage flavor works well)
- 0.5 cup dry rice, cooked (wild rice or brown rice recommended)
- 1 onion, diced
- 1-2 apples, diced (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp)
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 tsp dried sage (or 1 tbsp fresh)
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- [Optional] 0.25 cup dried cranberries or chopped pecans
- [Optional] Pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut acorn squash in half horizontally (around the middle) or vertically. Cut butternut squash vertically. Scoop out seeds.
- To make cutting easier, microwave the whole squash for 1-2 minutes to soften the skin slightly.

**Variations:**

- **Vegetarian**: Use chickpeas or lentils instead of sausage. Add walnuts for texture.
- **Squash Variety**: Delicata squash is also excellent and doesn't require peeling (you can eat the skin!).
- **Greens**: Mix in chopped kale or swiss chard into the filling for extra nutrients.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Roast Squash**:
    -   Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
    -   Brush the cut sides of the squash with oil and sprinkle with a little salt/pepper.
    -   Place cut-side down on a baking sheet. Roast for 30-40 minutes until tender when pierced with a fork.
2.  **Make Filling**:
    -   While squash roasts, brown the sausage in a skillet, breaking it up.
    -   Add onion and celery; sauté until soft.
    -   Add apples, sage, and thyme; cook 2-3 minutes until apples slightly soften.
    -   Stir in cooked rice and cranberries/nuts (if using).
3.  **Stuff & Bake**:
    -   Flip the roasted squash cut-side up.
    -   Mound the filling into the cavities.
    -   Return to oven for 10-15 minutes to heat through and crisp the top.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Winter squash is high in Vitamin A and fiber.
- **Serving**: This makes a complete meal, but a side green salad with vinaigrette balances the sweetness well.
