# Stuffed Peppers

Colorful bell peppers packed with a savory, protein-rich filling.

## Ingredients

### Peppers

- 4-6 large bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange are sweetest)
- 1 cup water (for baking dish)

### Filling

- 1 lb chicken breast, cubed
- 0.5 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 0.5 cup dry rice, cooked (brown rice, wild rice, or quinoa)
- 15 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped
- [Optional] 15 oz black beans, drained and rinsed
- [Optional] 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp garlic powder
- [Optional] 0.5 cup cheese (feta, parmesan, or light cheddar)
- [Optional] 2 tbsp walnuts or pepitas (pumpkin seeds)

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut the tops off the peppers and remove seeds/membranes. You can dice the edible parts of the tops and add them to the filling.
- Pre-cooking the rice/quinoa is essential.

**Variations:**

- **Protein Subs**: Chicken sausage (removed from casing), ground turkey, lean ground beef, or lentils.
- **Deconstructed (Skillet Style)**: Instead of stuffing whole peppers, dice all the peppers and sauté everything in a large skillet. Top with cheese and let melt. Much faster!
- **Grain-Free**: Substitute the rice with cauliflower rice.
- **Italian Style**: Use Italian seasoning, marinara instead of diced tomatoes, and mozzarella.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Heat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  **Prepare Peppers**: Arrange hollowed peppers upright in a baking dish. Pour water into the bottom of the dish to create steam.
3.  **Make Filling**:
    -   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
    -   Cook chicken (or other protein) with onion until browned.
    -   Stir in spinach and cook until wilted.
    -   Remove from heat. Mix in cooked rice, diced tomatoes, beans (if using), and seasonings.
4.  **Stuff**: Spoon the mixture generously into each pepper.
5.  **Bake**: Cover dish tightly with foil. Bake for 30-40 minutes until peppers are tender.
6.  **Finish**: Uncover, sprinkle with cheese and nuts/seeds (if using). Bake for another 5-10 minutes until cheese melts and seeds toast slightly.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Spinach adds iron and vitamins without altering the flavor much. Pepitas add magnesium and healthy fats.
- **Make Ahead**: You can stuff the peppers and store them in the fridge for up to a day before baking. Add 10-15 mins to bake time if cold.
