# Golden Goddess Soup

A vibrant, golden soup featuring cauliflower and carrots with warming turmeric and ginger, finished with creamy coconut milk and topped with crispy roasted chickpeas.

## Ingredients

### Soup Base

- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 inch piece fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tbsp turmeric powder (or fresh grated)
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- [Optional] 1 tbsp olive oil or coconut oil (for sautéing)

### Coconut Finish

- 7 oz lite coconut milk (half of a 14 oz can)
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp water

**Prep Notes:**

- Use "lite" coconut milk to keep calories down, or full-fat for extra creaminess
- Fresh turmeric can replace powder (use about 2 tbsp grated)
- Grate ginger on a microplane for best flavor distribution

**Variations:**

- **Full-Fat Coconut**: Use full-fat coconut milk (7 oz) for a richer, creamier soup
- **Protein Boost**: Add 1 can white beans or chickpeas to the soup base for extra protein
- **Spicy Version**: Add 1/2-1 tsp cayenne pepper or 1 fresh chili pepper with the aromatics
- **Thai-Inspired**: Replace turmeric with 1 tbsp curry paste and add lemongrass
- **Sweet Potato Addition**: Add 1 large sweet potato (cubed) with the cauliflower for extra body

### Crispy Chickpea Topping

- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and patted dry
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp paprika
- [Optional] 0.5 tsp cumin
- [Optional] 0.25 tsp salt
- [Optional] Pinch of cayenne

**Prep Notes:**

- Chickpeas MUST be completely dry for crispiness - pat with paper towels
- Roast separately while soup simmers for best texture contrast

**Variations:**

- **Skip the Roast**: Use canned chickpeas straight from the can for a quicker version
- **Seed Topping**: Replace chickpeas with toasted pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds
- **Crouton Style**: Use whole grain croutons instead of chickpeas

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Roast Chickpeas**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast preferred)
   - Toss dried chickpeas with oil and spices on a sheet pan
   - Roast for 20-25 minutes, shaking pan halfway through, until golden and crunchy
   - Set aside

2. **Make Soup Base**:
   - Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat
   - Add onion and carrots; sauté 5-7 minutes until softened
   - Add garlic, ginger, and turmeric; cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant
   - Add cauliflower florets and vegetable broth
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered for 20 minutes until vegetables are very tender

3. **Blend**:
   - Use an immersion blender to puree soup until completely smooth
   - Alternatively, carefully transfer to a blender in batches (remove lid center cap to allow steam to escape)

4. **Finish**:
   - Return soup to low heat
   - Stir in lite coconut milk
   - Mix cornstarch with water to make a slurry; stir into soup
   - Simmer 2-3 minutes, stirring, until slightly thickened
   - Fold in fresh spinach and stir until wilted (about 1 minute)

5. **Serve**: Ladle into bowls and top generously with crispy roasted chickpeas

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Slow Cooker**: Combine all soup base ingredients (except spinach and coconut) in slow cooker. Cook on low 6-7 hours or high 3-4 hours. Blend, then stir in coconut milk, cornstarch slurry, and spinach. Roast chickpeas separately as directed.

**Instant Pot**: Sauté aromatics using Sauté function. Add remaining soup base ingredients. Pressure cook on high for 8 minutes. Quick release, then blend. Stir in coconut milk, cornstarch slurry, and spinach.

## Notes

- Anti-inflammatory powerhouse: turmeric and ginger both have powerful anti-inflammatory properties
- For meal prep, store soup and chickpeas separately to keep topping crispy
- Soup freezes well for up to 3 months (freeze before adding coconut milk, add when reheating)
- The cornstarch thickens the soup slightly, making it more substantial
