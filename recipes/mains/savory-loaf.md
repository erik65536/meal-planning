# Savory Loaf (Meat or Lentil)

A modern take on the classic loaf. Moist, flavorful, and held together with oats and veggies instead of breadcrumbs.

## Ingredients

### The Base (Choose One)
- **Meat**: 1.5 lb Ground Beef (Lean) or Turkey
- **Lentil**: 2 cups Cooked Lentils (green/brown) + 1 cup Walnuts (finely chopped) + 1 cup Mushrooms (sautéed and minced)

### Binders & Flavor
- 1 cup Rolled Oats (quick or old fashioned)
- 1 Egg (or flax egg: 1 tbsp flaxmeal + 3 tbsp water)
- 1 Onion, finely diced
- 1 Carrot, grated
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp Dried Thyme
- 1 tsp Salt
- 0.5 tsp Black Pepper

### The Glaze
- 0.5 cup BBQ Sauce (No Sugar Added / Low Sodium)
- [Optional] 1 tbsp Tomato Paste mixed with 1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar

**Prep Notes:**
- For the Lentil version, it is crucial to mash the lentils slightly so they hold together, but leave some whole for texture.
- Grate the carrots finely so they cook through inside the loaf.

**Variations:**
- **Cheesy**: Mix 0.5 cup cheddar cheese into the loaf mixture.
- **Italian**: Use marinara sauce for the glaze and add oregano/basil to the loaf.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper or foil.
2.  **Prepare Veggies**:
    -   Sauté the onion and garlic in a little oil until soft (5 mins). This adds better flavor than raw onion.
    -   Let cool slightly.
3.  **Mix**:
    -   In a large bowl, combine the Base (Meat or Lentil mix), Oats, Egg, cooked onion/garlic, grated carrot, and seasonings.
    -   Mix with your hands until well combined. Do not overwork meat or it becomes tough.
4.  **Shape**:
    -   Press mixture firmly into the loaf pan to avoid air pockets.
    -   *Option*: Shape into a free-form log on a baking sheet for crispier edges.
5.  **Bake**:
    -   Bake for 30 minutes.
    -   Remove and brush the BBQ Glaze over the top.
    -   Bake for another 15-20 minutes.
        -   **Meat**: Internal temp should reach 160°F (70°C).
        -   **Lentil**: Should feel firm to the touch and browned.
6.  **Rest**:
    -   Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This keeps it from crumbling.

## Notes
- **Serving**: Serve with mashed cauliflower and roasted green beans.
- **Leftovers**: Makes excellent sandwiches (or lettuce wraps) the next day.
