# Cast Iron Pizza (Cauliflower Crust Supreme)

A low-carb, gluten-free pizza using a cauliflower-based crust, cooked in a cast iron skillet for crispy edges. Topped with Italian sausage, peppers, and plenty of cheese.

## Ingredients

### Cauliflower Crust

- 4 cups riced cauliflower (about 1 large head)
- 1 large egg
- 0.5 cup low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 0.25 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning (or mix of oregano, basil, garlic powder)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 0.25 tsp red pepper flakes
- [Optional] 1 clove garlic, minced

**Prep Notes:**

- **CRITICAL**: After steaming/microwaving cauliflower, wrap in clean kitchen towel and squeeze out ALL water. The "dough" must be as dry as possible or crust will be soggy
- Pre-riced cauliflower (frozen or fresh) saves time
- If starting with whole cauliflower, use food processor to rice it

**Variations:**

- **Broccoli Crust**: Replace cauliflower with riced broccoli
- **Mixed Veggie**: Use half cauliflower, half zucchini (zucchini must be squeezed very dry)
- **Almond Flour Addition**: Add 2 tbsp almond flour for sturdier crust
- **Traditional Crust**: Use regular pizza dough if not avoiding carbs/gluten

### Pizza Toppings

- 0.5 cup pizza sauce or marinara
- 2 Italian sausage links, casings removed, sliced into coins or crumbled
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- 0.25 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- [Optional] 0.25 cup Parmesan, grated
- [Optional] 8-10 slices pepperoni
- [Optional] 0.5 cup mushrooms, sliced
- [Optional] Fresh basil leaves
- [Optional] Red pepper flakes
- [Optional] Drizzle of olive oil

**Prep Notes:**

- Use RAW sausage - it will cook during the final bake
- Slice sausage thinly so it cooks through in the baking time
- Pre-cook sausage if using thick slices

**Variations:**

- **Margherita**: Just sauce, fresh mozzarella, tomato slices, and fresh basil
- **Veggie Supreme**: Mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, spinach
- **Meat Lovers**: Sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and ham
- **BBQ Chicken**: BBQ sauce base, cooked chicken, red onion, cilantro
- **White Pizza**: No sauce, ricotta base, garlic, spinach, and mozzarella
- **Hawaiian**: Ham and pineapple (controversial but delicious)

### For the Skillet

- 1-2 tbsp olive oil (for greasing cast iron)

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Cauliflower**:
   - If using fresh cauliflower head, cut into florets and pulse in food processor until rice-like texture
   - Place riced cauliflower in microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave 8-10 minutes until very soft
   - Alternatively, steam on stovetop 10-12 minutes
   - Let cool 5 minutes, then transfer to clean kitchen towel
   - Wrap tightly and twist/squeeze aggressively to remove ALL moisture (this is the most important step!)
   - You should extract 1/2 to 1 cup of liquid

2. **Make Crust "Dough"**:
   - Transfer squeezed-dry cauliflower to mixing bowl
   - Add egg, mozzarella, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper
   - Mix thoroughly with hands until well combined into a dough-like consistency

3. **Blind Bake Crust**:
   - Preheat oven to 425°F (standard bake - convection NOT recommended as it may dry out crust too much or burn toppings before crust sets)
   - Generously oil a 10-12 inch cast iron skillet
   - Press cauliflower mixture into bottom of skillet in an even layer, extending up sides slightly
   - Bake empty crust 10-15 minutes until edges are golden brown and crust is set/firm to touch
   - Remove from oven

4. **Add Toppings**:
   - Spread pizza sauce over par-baked crust
   - Sprinkle half the mozzarella cheese
   - Add raw sausage slices/crumbles, diced bell pepper, and sliced onion
   - Top with remaining mozzarella and optional Parmesan

5. **Final Bake**:
   - Return to oven and bake another 10-12 minutes
   - Pizza is done when cheese is melted and bubbly, sausage is cooked through (no pink), and edges are deeply golden
   - If cheese isn't browning enough, broil on high for 1-2 minutes (watch closely!)

6. **Serve**:
   - Let cool 5 minutes before slicing (crust will firm up as it cools)
   - Cut into wedges like traditional pizza
   - Garnish with fresh basil, red pepper flakes, or olive oil drizzle

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Sheet Pan**: Press crust mixture onto parchment-lined sheet pan in a rectangle or circle. Blind bake at 425°F for 15-20 minutes, add toppings, bake another 10-12 minutes.

**Pizza Stone**: Shape crust on parchment paper, slide onto preheated pizza stone. Blind bake 12-15 minutes, add toppings, bake 8-10 more minutes.

**Regular Pizza Dough**: If not using cauliflower crust, skip blind bake. Press dough into oiled cast iron, add toppings, and bake 15-18 minutes at 450°F.

## Notes

- Cast iron creates a crispy bottom crust that's hard to achieve with cauliflower on a regular baking sheet
- The "supreme" topping combination (sausage, peppers, onions) is classic, but customize however you like
- Cauliflower crust is more delicate than traditional dough - eat with fork and knife or support slices from underneath
- Leftovers reheat well in a skillet or oven (not microwave, which makes crust soggy)
- This crust has about 75% fewer carbs than traditional pizza dough
- For meal prep, make multiple crusts and freeze after blind baking (thaw before topping and final bake)
