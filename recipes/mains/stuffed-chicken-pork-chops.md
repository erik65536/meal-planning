# Stuffed Chicken Breasts or Pork Chops

Tender chicken breasts or pork chops butterflied and stuffed with savory cornbread stuffing. The cornbread can be made a day ahead for convenience.

## Ingredients

### Protein (Choose One)

- **Chicken**: 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6-8 oz each)
- **Pork Chops**: 2 thick-cut boneless pork chops (1-1.5 inch thick, 6-8 oz each)

### Cornbread Base (Make 1 Day in Advance)

- 0.5 cup (60g) cornmeal (fine or medium ground)
- 0.5 cup (63g) all-purpose flour
- 0.5 tsp baking powder
- 0.25 tsp baking soda
- Pinch of salt
- 0.25 cup (4 Tbsp; 56g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 2 tbsp (43g) honey
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 0.5 cup (120ml) buttermilk, at room temperature

**Prep Notes:**

- Cornbread must be made at least 1 day ahead to dry out slightly for better stuffing texture
- Do not cover cornbread while it cools overnight - this helps it dry out

**Variations:**

- **Skip Homemade**: Use 2-3 cups store-bought cornbread or cornbread stuffing mix
- **Jalapeño Cornbread**: Add 1 diced jalapeño to the batter for a kick
- **Herbed Cornbread**: Add 0.5 tsp dried sage and 0.5 tsp dried thyme to the batter

### Stuffing Mixture

- 0.5-0.75 cup (120-180ml) reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1 large egg
- 1 tbsp (14g) unsalted butter
- 0.5 small onion, diced (or 0.25 cup diced)
- 0.5 celery stalk, diced
- 0.5 tsp dried thyme (or 1.5 tsp fresh)
- 0.5 tsp dried sage (or 1.5 tsp fresh)
- 1.5 tsp fresh parsley, chopped (or 0.5 tsp dried)
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- [Optional] 0.25 lb (113g) uncooked mild Italian sausage, removed from casing
- [Optional] 2 tbsp pecans, chopped
- [Optional] 2 tbsp dried cranberries

**Prep Notes:**

- Use less broth (0.5 cup) for a firmer stuffing that's easier to handle
- Sausage is optional but adds rich flavor

**Variations:**

- **Mushroom & Herb**: Omit sausage, add 4 oz sliced mushrooms sautéed with the vegetables
- **Apple & Sage**: Add 0.5 diced apple and increase sage to 1 tsp
- **Vegetarian**: Skip the sausage, use vegetable broth, add extra mushrooms or nuts

### For Assembly

- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter (for searing)
- Salt and pepper (for seasoning protein)
- [Optional] Kitchen twine or toothpicks (to secure stuffed protein)

## Cooking Instructions

### Day 1: Make Cornbread

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F (191°C).
2.  **Mix Batter**: In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add melted butter, honey, egg, and buttermilk. Whisk until just combined.
3.  **Bake**: Pour into a greased 9-inch square baking pan. Bake for 22-24 minutes until top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean.
4.  **Cool**: Let cool completely on counter overnight, uncovered.

### Day 2: Prepare Stuffing

1.  **Toast Cornbread**: Preheat oven to 300°F (149°C). Cut cornbread into 1-inch cubes (should yield 2-3 cups). Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes until slightly crisp. Set aside to cool.
2.  **Make Stuffing Base**: In a large bowl, whisk together broth and egg. Set aside.
3.  **Cook Filling**: Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, thyme, sage, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook 4 minutes until vegetables soften. If using sausage, squeeze meat into the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook about 4 minutes until just cooked through.
4.  **Combine**: Pour sausage-vegetable mixture (including any liquid) into the broth-egg mixture. Add toasted cornbread cubes and pecans/cranberries if using. Gently fold together. Let cool to room temperature.

### Stuff and Cook Protein

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  **Butterfly**: Place chicken breasts or pork chops on cutting board. Using a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut horizontally through the thickest part, stopping about 0.5 inch from the edge (like opening a book). Open and gently pound to even thickness (about 0.75 inch).
3.  **Season**: Season the inside with salt and pepper.
4.  **Stuff**: Place 0.5-0.75 cup stuffing mixture on one half of each butterflied piece. Fold over and secure with toothpicks or kitchen twine. Season outside with salt and pepper.
5.  **Sear**: Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear stuffed pieces 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown.
6.  **Bake**:
    - **Chicken**: Transfer skillet to oven, bake 20-25 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
    - **Pork**: Transfer skillet to oven, bake 15-20 minutes until internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C).
7.  **Rest**: Let rest 5 minutes before removing toothpicks/twine. Slice and serve.

**Alternative Baking Method:**

- If you don't have leftover stuffing to use separately, you can skip searing and place stuffed protein pieces in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake chicken at 375°F for 35-40 minutes, pork for 30-35 minutes.

## Notes

- **Make Ahead**: Prepare cornbread and stuffing mixture up to 1 day ahead. Stuff protein up to 4 hours before cooking (refrigerate).
- **Extra Stuffing**: If you have leftover stuffing (likely if you don't use sausage), bake it separately in a greased dish at 375°F for 30-35 minutes alongside the protein.
- **Meat Thermometer**: Essential for ensuring protein is cooked through without drying out. Chicken should reach 165°F, pork 145°F.
- **Nutrient Boost**: The cornbread provides complex carbs and fiber. Add extra vegetables to the stuffing (mushrooms, diced bell peppers) for more nutrients.
- **Leftovers**: Slice leftover stuffed protein and reheat gently in a covered dish with a splash of broth to prevent drying.

## Side Dish Ideas

- **Roasted Vegetables**: Brussels sprouts, green beans, or asparagus with garlic and lemon
- **Mashed Potatoes**: Classic creamy mashed potatoes or garlic mashed cauliflower for lower-carb
- **Simple Salad**: Mixed greens with apple slices, pecans, and balsamic vinaigrette
- **Roasted Sweet Potatoes**: Cubed and roasted with olive oil and herbs
- **Sautéed Greens**: Kale, Swiss chard, or spinach with garlic
- **Cranberry Sauce**: Homemade or canned cranberry sauce pairs beautifully with the cornbread stuffing
- **Glazed Carrots**: Honey or maple glazed carrots with fresh thyme
- **Green Bean Casserole**: For a more indulgent, holiday-style meal
