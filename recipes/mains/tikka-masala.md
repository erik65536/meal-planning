# Tikka Masala

A rich, creamy, and spiced curry that can be made with chicken or chickpeas.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced (optional, but recommended for base)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced

### Spices

- 2 tsp garam masala
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp fenugreek powder (methi)
- [Optional] 0.5 tsp cayenne (for heat)
- 2 packets sodium-free chicken bouillon powder

### Sauce & Veggies

- 15 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 15 oz can diced tomatoes (or fresh)
- 2 cups cauliflower florets
- 1-3 carrots, sliced
- [Optional] 0.5 cup frozen peas or spinach
- 0.5 cup plain Greek yogurt (stirred in at end)

### Protein (Choose One)

- 1 lb chicken breast/thighs, cubed
- 15 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 lb tofu, cubed and pressed

### Serving

- 0.5 cup dry rice, cooked (Basmati recommended)
- [Optional] Naan bread
- [Optional] Fresh cilantro, chopped

**Prep Notes:**

- Marinating the chicken in a little yogurt and spices for 30 mins beforehand tenderizes it, but isn't strictly necessary for a quick weeknight version.

**Variations:**

- **Coconut**: Swap Greek yogurt for coconut milk for a dairy-free/richer version.
- **Veggie Overload**: Add bell peppers, zucchini, or sweet potato cubes.
- **Butter Chicken Style**: Add 1 tbsp butter at the end for richness.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sauté Base**:
    -   Heat oil in a large pot/Dutch oven over medium heat.
    -   Add onion (if using) and carrots. Sauté 5-7 minutes.
    -   Add garlic, ginger, and spices. Cook 1 minute until fragrant.
2.  **Brown Protein**:
    -   Add chicken (if using) and coat in spices. Cook 2-3 minutes (it doesn't need to be fully cooked yet).
    -   *If using chickpeas/tofu*: Add them now.
3.  **Simmer**:
    -   Pour in crushed and diced tomatoes.
    -   Stir in bouillon powder.
    -   Add cauliflower.
    -   Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes until cauliflower is tender and chicken is cooked through.
4.  **Finish**:
    -   Remove from heat.
    -   Stir in spinach/peas (they will cook in residual heat).
    -   Slowly stir in Greek yogurt (do not boil after adding yogurt or it may split).
5.  **Serve**: Over rice with cilantro.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory. Fenugreek aids digestion.
- **Sodium**: Using sodium-free bouillon and plain tomatoes gives you full control over salt.
