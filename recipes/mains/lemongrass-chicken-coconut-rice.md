# Vietnamese Lemongrass Chicken & Coconut Rice

Aromatic lemongrass-marinated chicken thighs roasted with tomatoes and onions, served over fragrant coconut-infused jasmine rice.

## Ingredients

### Chicken & Marinade

- 1.5-2 lbs chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on for best flavor)
- 2 tbsp lemongrass paste (or 3 stalks fresh lemongrass, minced)
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp lime juice (about 1 lime)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- [Optional] 1 tsp black pepper
- [Optional] 1 tbsp neutral oil

**Prep Notes:**

- Marinate minimum 30 minutes, preferably 4+ hours or overnight for maximum flavor
- If using fresh lemongrass, use only the tender bottom 4 inches of the stalk, minced very finely
- Score the chicken skin to help marinade penetrate

**Variations:**

- **Boneless Thighs**: Use 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless thighs (reduce cooking time to 20-25 minutes)
- **Chicken Drumsticks**: Use drumsticks instead (increase cooking time to 35-40 minutes)
- **Pork Chops**: Works beautifully with bone-in pork chops (cook to 145°F)
- **Shrimp**: Use 1.5 lbs large shrimp (reduce roasting time to just 8-10 minutes)
- **Tofu**: Use pressed extra-firm tofu cubes (marinate 1+ hour, roast 25 minutes)

### Roasted Vegetables

- 4-5 Roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 1 medium onion, cut into thick wedges
- [Optional] 1 bell pepper, cut into strips
- [Optional] 1 tbsp oil for tossing vegetables

**Prep Notes:**

- Keep onion wedges intact (don't separate layers) so they char nicely
- Tomatoes will release juices that create a light sauce

**Variations:**

- **Eggplant Addition**: Add 1 Asian eggplant, sliced into rounds
- **Green Beans**: Add trimmed green beans for extra vegetables
- **Zucchini**: Add thick half-moons of zucchini

### Coconut Rice

- 1.5 cups jasmine rice (rinsed)
- 7 oz lite coconut milk (remaining half can from Golden Goddess Soup)
- 1.25 cups water (adjust based on coconut milk volume)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- [Optional] 1 pandan leaf (for authentic aroma)
- [Optional] 1 tsp sugar

**Prep Notes:**

- Standard rice ratio is 1:1.5 (rice:liquid). Since we're using coconut milk + water, total liquid should be about 2.25 cups for 1.5 cups rice
- Rinse rice until water runs clear to remove excess starch

**Variations:**

- **Full Coconut**: Use full-fat coconut milk for richer flavor
- **Brown Rice**: Use brown jasmine rice (increase liquid to 2.5 cups and cooking time to 40-45 minutes)
- **Cauliflower Rice**: Use riced cauliflower sautéed with a splash of coconut milk for low-carb option

### For Serving

- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges
- [Optional] Sliced cucumber
- [Optional] Pickled vegetables (daikon, carrots)
- [Optional] Fresh Thai basil

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Marinate Chicken**:
   - In a bowl or zip-top bag, combine lemongrass, fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, garlic, soy sauce, and black pepper
   - Add chicken thighs and turn to coat completely
   - Refrigerate minimum 30 minutes (4+ hours ideal)

2. **Prepare Rice**:
   - Combine rinsed jasmine rice, coconut milk, water, and salt in a medium pot
   - Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce to lowest heat
   - Cover tightly and simmer 15 minutes without lifting lid
   - Remove from heat and let rest, covered, 5-10 minutes
   - Fluff with fork before serving

3. **Roast Chicken & Vegetables**:
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (convection roast preferred) or 425°F (standard bake)
   - Arrange chicken thighs skin-side up on a rimmed sheet pan
   - Arrange tomato halves and onion wedges around chicken
   - Pour any remaining marinade over chicken
   - Roast 25-30 minutes until chicken reaches 165°F internal temperature and skin is golden and crispy
   - Tomatoes should be soft and slightly charred, onions caramelized

4. **Serve**:
   - Fluff coconut rice and portion onto plates
   - Top with chicken thigh, roasted vegetables, and any pan juices
   - Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Grill**: Marinate chicken as directed. Grill over medium-high heat 6-7 minutes per side until charred and cooked through. Roast vegetables separately on a grill basket or alongside in foil packets.

**Stovetop**: Brown marinated chicken in a large skillet, skin-side down first, 5-6 minutes per side. Add vegetables to pan, cover, and cook 10-15 minutes until chicken is cooked through.

**Slow Cooker**: Place vegetables in bottom of slow cooker, top with marinated chicken. Cook on low 4-5 hours or high 2-3 hours. Skin won't crisp, but meat will be very tender.

## Notes

- Fish sauce is essential for authentic Vietnamese flavor - don't skip it
- The combination of sweet (brown sugar), salty (fish sauce, soy), sour (lime), and aromatic (lemongrass) creates the classic Vietnamese flavor balance
- Save extra coconut milk for smoothies or freeze in ice cube trays
- Chicken skin crisps best when oven is fully preheated
- Recipe pairs beautifully with Golden Goddess Soup if making both in the same week (shares coconut milk can)
