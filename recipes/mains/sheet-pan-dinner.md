# Sheet Pan Dinner

The ultimate low-effort meal. Roast protein and veggies together on one tray for easy cleanup.

## Ingredients

### Protein Options (Choose One)

- **Salmon**: 2-4 fillets (skin-on or off)
- **Pork Loin**: 1 lb, cubed or sliced into medallions
- **Chicken**: Thighs or breasts, cut into chunks
- **Sausage**: Sliced into coins
- **Steak**: Cubed (cook time will be short)

### Veggie Options (Choose 2-3)

- **Roots**: Potatoes (sweet or russet), Carrots, Parsnips (diced 0.5 inch)
- **Cruciferous**: Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts (halved)
- **Soft**: Cherry tomatoes, Bell peppers, Zucchini, Green beans, Asparagus
- **Squash**: Butternut or Acorn squash (cubed)

### Seasoning Base

- 1-2 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
- Salt & Pepper
- [Optional] Garlic powder, onion powder, dried herbs (thyme/rosemary/oregano)

### Flavor Combinations

- **Salmon & Veggies**: Salmon + Potatoes + Cherry Tomatoes + Green Beans. Season with lemon & dill.
- **Pork & Veggies**: Pork Loin + Sweet Potato + Broccoli + Red Onion. Season with paprika & garlic.
- **Meat & Veggies**: Steak/Sausage + Bell Peppers + Zucchini + Potatoes. Season with cajun spice or Italian herbs.

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut hard veggies (potatoes, carrots, squash) smaller so they cook at the same rate as softer veggies/protein.
- Dry the protein and veggies well before oiling to ensure roasting (browning) rather than steaming.

**Variations:**

- **Sauce it up**: Drizzle with balsamic glaze, pesto, or tahini dressing after baking.
- **Vegetarian**: Use chickpeas or tofu blocks as the protein.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F (200°C) or 425°F (220°C) for extra crisping.
2.  **Timing Strategy**:
    -   *Hard Veggies First*: If using potatoes/carrots/squash, toss with oil/seasoning and roast for 15-20 minutes first.
    -   *Add Protein & Soft Veggies*: Remove pan, push hard veggies to side. Add protein and softer veggies (broccoli, peppers, tomatoes).
3.  **Roast**: Return to oven for 10-15 minutes until protein is cooked through (Salmon: ~12 mins, Chicken chunks: ~15 mins, Pork: ~15 mins).
4.  **Finish**: Toss with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Cherry tomatoes release lycopene when roasted. Cruciferous veggies provide sulforaphane.
- **Sheet Pan Care**: Line with parchment paper for the easiest cleanup of your life.
