# Stir Fry (Chinese & Korean Styles)

A versatile template for a quick, vegetable-packed stir fry with two distinct flavor profiles.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 lb protein (pork loin, beef, chicken breast, shrimp, tofu, or seafood mix)
- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced or sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced
- 4 cups mixed veggies (broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, snow peas, bok choy)

### Carb (Choose One)

- 4 oz noodles (rice noodles, udon, ramen, or soba), cooked
- 1 cup dry rice, cooked

### Sauce Options

#### Chinese Style
- 2 tsp soy sauce powder (reconstituted) or 2 tbsp soy sauce/tamari
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp Chinese five spice

#### Korean Style
- 2 tsp soy sauce powder (reconstituted) or 2 tbsp soy sauce/tamari
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- 2 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes)
- 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 tsp plum sauce (or honey/maple syrup)
- [Optional] 4 oz kimchi, chopped

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut protein into bite-sized cubes or thin strips.
- Cut veggies into uniform pieces. Hard veggies (carrots, broccoli stems) take longer to cook than soft ones (peppers, leafy greens).
- Mix sauce ingredients in a small jar/bowl before starting to cook.

**Variations:**

- **Low Carb**: Use zucchini noodles or konjac noodles, or just extra veggies.
- **Extra Crunch**: Top with sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, or cashews.
- **Veggie Heavy**: Don't be afraid to increase the veg volume to 5-6 cups for more volume and fiber.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Prep**: Cook noodles or rice according to package. Drain and rinse noodles cold to stop sticking.
2.  **Sear Protein**:
    -   Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.
    -   Add protein (in batches if needed). Sear until browned and cooked through. Remove and set aside.
3.  **Cook Veggies**:
    -   Add a little more oil if pan is dry. Add onion, carrots, and broccoli. Stir fry 2-3 mins.
    -   Add softer veggies (peppers, snow peas) and cook 1-2 mins.
    -   Add garlic and ginger; cook 30 seconds until fragrant (don't burn).
4.  **Combine**:
    -   Return protein to pan.
    -   Add kimchi (if making Korean style).
    -   Add noodles/rice to the pan (or serve over rice separately).
5.  **Sauce**: Pour sauce over everything. Toss vigorously for 1-2 minutes until everything is coated and hot.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Add leafy greens like bok choy or spinach at the very end to wilt.
- **Sodium Control**: Use low-sodium soy sauce or tamari. The fish/oyster sauces are salty, so adjust to taste.
