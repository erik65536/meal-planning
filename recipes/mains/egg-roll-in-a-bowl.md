# Egg Roll in a Bowl

All the flavors of an egg roll without the wrapper (or the deep frying).

## Ingredients

### Base

- 8 oz ground beef, turkey, or pork
- 0.5 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 8 oz mushrooms, sliced (optional, adds umami)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced

### The Crunch

- 0.5 head cabbage, shredded (or 1 bag coleslaw mix)
- 2-3 carrots, julienned (if not using mix)
- [Optional] Green onions, sliced

### Sauce

- 1 tbsp soy sauce powder (reconstituted) or soy sauce/tamari
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- [Optional] 1 tsp plum sauce or hoisin (for sweetness)
- [Optional] Sriracha or chili garlic sauce (for heat)

### Peanut Sauce Variation (Optional)

- 2 tbsp peanut butter
- 1 tbsp warm water (to thin)

**Prep Notes:**

- Buying a pre-shredded coleslaw mix makes this recipe incredibly fast (under 15 mins).

**Variations:**

- **Protein**: Ground chicken or crumbled tofu work great.
- **Veggie**: Add broccoli slaw or thinly sliced bell peppers.
- **Crunch**: Top with sesame seeds or wonton strips (if not avoiding carbs).

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Cook Meat**:
    -   Heat oil in a large skillet/wok.
    -   Brown meat with onion and mushrooms until fully cooked. Drain excess fat.
2.  **Aromatics**:
    -   Add garlic and ginger. Cook 30 seconds.
3.  **Wilt Cabbage**:
    -   Add cabbage/carrots. Toss to combine.
    -   Cook 3-5 minutes until cabbage is wilted but still has crunch.
4.  **Sauce**:
    -   Pour soy sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce, etc. over the mixture.
    -   (If using peanut butter, whisk it with the sauces first).
    -   Toss well.
5.  **Serve**: Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Cabbage is a cruciferous vegetable rich in Vitamin K and C.
- **Low Sodium**: Omit fish sauce/oyster sauce if watching sodium strictly, and increase ginger/garlic for flavor.
