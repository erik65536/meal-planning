# White Bean & Kale Soup

A hearty, rustic soup inspired by Tuscan flavors. Creamy beans and nutritious kale make a perfect pair.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 0.5 cup carrots, sliced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

### Protein

- 2 x 15 oz cans white beans (Cannellini, Navy, or Great Northern), drained and rinsed
- [Optional] 1 can beans + 1 lb chicken sausage (sliced) or cubed cooked chicken

### Liquid & Seasoning

- 4-6 cups water
- 2 packets sodium-free chicken bouillon powder
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cumin (optional, for warmth)
- [Optional] 15 oz can diced tomatoes
- [Optional] Parmesan rind (simmered in soup)

### Greens

- 4 cups kale, stems removed and chopped
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

**Prep Notes:**

- Mashing 1/2 cup of the beans before adding them thickens the soup naturally.

**Variations:**

- **Creamy**: Stir in a splash of milk or cream at the end.
- **Spicy**: Add red pepper flakes.
- **Grain**: Add 1/2 cup small pasta (ditalini) or quinoa.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sauté**:
    -   Heat oil in a soup pot.
    -   Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook 5-7 minutes until soft.
    -   Add garlic and sausage (if using). Cook 2 minutes.
2.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add dried herbs, bouillon, water, beans, and tomatoes (if using).
    -   (Add parmesan rind now if you have one).
    -   Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15-20 minutes.
3.  **Finish**:
    -   Stir in kale. Cook 3-5 minutes until wilted.
    -   Stir in lemon juice.
    -   Remove parmesan rind.
    -   Season with pepper.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Kale is a nutrient powerhouse. Adding lemon juice (Vitamin C) helps absorb the iron from the kale and beans.
