# Lentil Soup

A humble yet deeply satisfying soup that is naturally healthy and filling.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced

### The Lentils

- 1.5 cups dry lentils (Green or Brown hold shape best; Red break down for creamy soup)
- 4-6 cups vegetable broth (or water + bouillon)
- 14 oz can crushed or diced tomatoes

### Seasoning

- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- [Optional] 1 tsp curry powder (for a warming twist)
- [Optional] 0.25 tsp red pepper flakes

### Finish

- 2 cups kale or spinach, chopped
- 1 tbsp lemon juice (crucial for brightness)
- [Optional] Fresh parsley

**Prep Notes:**

- Pick through dry lentils to remove any small stones/debris, then rinse well.
- No need to soak lentils beforehand!

**Variations:**

- **Curry Lentil Soup**: Add 1 tbsp curry powder and swap half the water for coconut milk.
- **Sausage Lentil**: Brown sliced chicken sausage in the pot before adding veggies.
- **Sweet Potato**: Add cubed sweet potato with the lentils for extra bulk.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sauté**:
    -   Heat oil in a large pot.
    -   Add onion, carrots, and celery (mirepoix). Sauté 5-7 minutes.
    -   Add garlic and spices. Cook 1 minute.
2.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add lentils, broth, tomatoes, and bay leaf.
    -   Bring to boil, reduce heat to low-medium.
    -   Simmer partially covered for 25-35 minutes until lentils are tender.
3.  **Finish**:
    -   Remove bay leaf.
    -   Puree 1-2 cups of the soup (or use immersion blender briefly) if you want a thicker texture.
    -   Stir in kale/spinach and cook 3 mins.
    -   Stir in lemon juice.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Lentils are one of the best plant-based protein sources and very high in folate.
