# Zucchini Lasagna (No Noodle)

All the comfort of lasagna without the pasta. Roasted zucchini slices replace the noodles for a lighter, nutrient-dense meal.

## Ingredients

### The "Noodles"
- 3-4 large Zucchini, sliced lengthwise into 1/4 inch thick strips
- Salt (for sweating)

### The Sauce (Bolognese Style)
- 1 lb Ground Beef, Turkey, or Lentils
- 1 jar (24 oz) Marinara Sauce (Low sugar/sodium)
- 1 Onion, diced
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1 tsp Dried Oregano

### The Creamy Layer
- 1 cup Ricotta Cheese or Cottage Cheese
- 0.5 cup Greek Yogurt (adds tang and protein)
- 1 Egg (to bind)
- 0.5 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tsp Dried Basil

### Topping
- 1 cup Mozzarella cheese, shredded

**Prep Notes:**
- **Crucial Step**: Zucchini contains a lot of water. You must salt it and roast/pat it dry before assembling, otherwise, you will have zucchini soup.

**Variations:**
- **Eggplant**: Use eggplant slices instead of zucchini (roast them first too).
- **Dairy Free**: Use almond ricotta substitute and nutritional yeast instead of cheese.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Prep Zucchini**:
    -   Slice zucchini. Lay on baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt. Let sit 15 mins to draw out water.
    -   Pat dry with paper towels.
    -   *Better method*: Roast slices at 400°F (200°C) for 10-15 mins to dry them out further.
2.  **Make Sauce**:
    -   Brown the meat/lentils with onion and garlic in a pot.
    -   Add marinara sauce and oregano. Simmer 10 mins to thicken.
3.  **Make Cheese Mixture**:
    -   Mix ricotta/cottage cheese, yogurt, egg, parmesan, and basil in a bowl.
4.  **Assemble**:
    -   Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
    -   Spread a thin layer of sauce.
    -   **Layer 1**: Zucchini slices (slightly overlapping).
    -   **Layer 2**: 1/2 of the Cheese Mixture.
    -   **Layer 3**: 1/2 of the Sauce.
    -   **Repeat**: Zucchini -> Cheese -> Sauce.
    -   **Top**: Sprinkle Mozzarella cheese over everything.
5.  **Bake**:
    -   Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes (uncovered) until cheese is browned and bubbly.
6.  **Rest**:
    -   Let stand for 15-20 minutes before cutting. This allows the layers to set so it doesn't slide apart.

## Notes
- **Nutrient Boost**: Zucchini is low calorie and high in antioxidants. This dish is significantly lower in carbs than traditional lasagna.
- **Make Ahead**: You can assemble this a day ahead and bake it when ready.
