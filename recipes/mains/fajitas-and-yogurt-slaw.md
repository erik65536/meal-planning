# Fajitas & Yogurt Slaw

A fresh, nutrient-dense take on fajitas with a zesty probiotic yogurt slaw.

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 1 lb chicken breast, cubed
- 0.5 tbsp avocado oil
- 1-2 bell peppers, sliced (any color)
- 1 onion, sliced (red or yellow)
- [Optional] 1-3 chipotles in adobo, diced
- [Optional] 1 cup black beans, drained and rinsed

### Seasoning Blend

- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1.5 tsp smoked paprika
- 1.5 tsp Mexican oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp coriander

### Slaw

- 0.5 head cabbage, shredded (green or purple for antioxidants)
- 0.5 cup carrots, julienned
- 0.5 cup plain Greek yogurt (non-fat or low-fat)
- 1 tbsp cumin
- [Optional] 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice
- [Optional] 1-2 chipotles in adobo, diced

### Assembly

- Low-carb or whole wheat tortillas
- [Optional] Salsa (Pico de Gallo or Tomatillo for lower calories)
- [Optional] Cilantro lime rice or Cauliflower rice

**Prep Notes:**

- Slice peppers and onions to a similar thickness as the chicken for even cooking.
- Make the slaw first to let the flavors meld while you cook the meat.

**Variations:**

- **Protein Subs**: Ground turkey, shrimp (cook quickly!), tofu (press first), or lean steak strips.
- **Veggie Add-ins**: Zucchini, mushrooms, or corn can be sautéed with the peppers.
- **Bowl Style**: Ditch the tortilla and serve over a bed of greens or brown rice/quinoa for a "Fajita Bowl".
- **Spicy Kick**: Add fresh jalapeños or extra chipotle peppers.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Make the Slaw**: In a medium bowl, mix the Greek yogurt, cumin, lime juice, and chipotles (if using). Toss with the cabbage and carrots until coated. Refrigerate until serving.
2.  **Mix Seasoning**: Combine all spices in a small bowl.
3.  **Cook Filling**:
    -   Heat avocado oil in a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high heat.
    -   Add chicken (or chosen protein) and half the seasoning. Cook until browned and nearly cooked through (5-7 mins). Remove from pan if needed to avoid overcrowding.
    -   Add onions and peppers to the hot pan. Sauté until tender-crisp (3-5 mins).
    -   Return chicken to the pan. Add the remaining seasoning and splash of water if dry.
    -   Stir in black beans (if using) and cook for 1-2 minutes until heated through.
4.  **Assemble**: Warm tortillas in a dry skillet. Fill with meat/veggie mixture and top with a generous portion of the yogurt slaw.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: The Greek yogurt adds protein and probiotics compared to sour cream. Purple cabbage adds extra anthocyanins (antioxidants).
- **Meal Prep**: The slaw keeps well for 1-2 days. Store filling and tortillas separately.
