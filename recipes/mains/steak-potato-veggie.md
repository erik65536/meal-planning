# Steak, Potato, & Veggie

A balanced plate featuring quality protein, complex carbs, and seasonal vegetables.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 1 lb steak (Sirloin, Ribeye, or New York Strip)
- Salt & Black Pepper (coarse ground)
- [Optional] Garlic butter or fresh herbs (rosemary/thyme)

### Starch

- 2 Sweet Potatoes or Russet Potatoes
- [Optional] Toppings: Greek yogurt, chives, cinnamon (for sweet potato)

### Vegetable

- 1 lb seasonal veggie (Choose one):
    -   **Green Beans**: Trimmed
    -   **Asparagus**: Woody ends removed
    -   **Corn on the Cob**
    -   **Broccoli/Cauliflower**: Florets
- 1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
- Lemon juice (for finishing green veggies)

**Prep Notes:**

- Let steak come to room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking for even doneness.
- Wash potatoes thoroughly; eat the skin for extra fiber.

**Variations:**

- **Protein Subs**: Chicken breast (grilled or pan-seared), Salmon fillet, or Pork chop.
- **Cooking Method**:
    -   *Grilled*: Cook everything on the grill for ease and flavor.
    -   *Sheet Pan*: Roast potatoes and veggies; sear steak separately.
- **Low Carb**: Swap potato for mashed cauliflower or roasted butternut squash cubes.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Potatoes (Microwave + Crisp method)**:
    -   Poke holes in potatoes. Microwave for 5-7 minutes until soft.
    -   Finish in a 400°F oven for 10-15 minutes to crisp skin, OR slice and sear in the pan after the steak.
2.  **Steak**:
    -   Pat steak dry. Season generously with salt and pepper.
    -   Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat with a little oil.
    -   Sear steak 3-4 minutes per side (depending on thickness and preference).
    -   Let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
3.  **Veggies**:
    -   *Asparagus/Green Beans*: Sauté in the same pan while steak rests (add a splash of water to steam if needed), or roast with the potatoes.
    -   *Corn*: Boil for 5-7 minutes or grill.
    -   Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Sweet potatoes are lower glycemic and high in Vitamin A compared to russets.
- **Healthy Fats**: Use avocado oil for high-heat searing to avoid oxidizing the oil.
