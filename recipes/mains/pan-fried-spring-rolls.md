# Pan-Fried Pork Spring Rolls with Blistered Vegetables

Crispy, golden spring rolls filled with savory seasoned pork, pan-fried (not deep-fried) for a lighter approach. Served alongside charred green beans and burst cherry tomatoes.

## Ingredients

### Spring Roll Filling

- 1 lb ground pork
- 2 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- [Optional] 1 cup shredded cabbage or napa cabbage
- [Optional] 0.5 cup shredded carrots
- [Optional] 2 oz mushrooms, finely diced
- [Optional] 1 tsp rice vinegar
- [Optional] 0.25 tsp white pepper

**Prep Notes:**

- Mix filling thoroughly but don't overwork the meat
- If adding cabbage/carrots, squeeze out excess moisture to prevent soggy rolls
- Filling can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated

**Variations:**

- **Chicken or Turkey**: Replace pork with ground chicken or turkey for a leaner option
- **Shrimp**: Use 1 lb peeled shrimp, roughly chopped, for a seafood version
- **Vegetarian**: Use crumbled firm tofu or plant-based ground meat with extra mushrooms
- **Spicy**: Add 1 tsp chili garlic sauce or sriracha to the filling
- **Thai-Inspired**: Add 1 tbsp fish sauce, lime zest, and fresh Thai basil

### Wrappers

- 8-10 dry spring roll wrappers (wheat-based) OR rice paper rounds
- Water (for sealing wheat wrappers) OR bowl of warm water (for hydrating rice paper)
- [Optional] 1 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water (for wheat wrapper sealing)

**Prep Notes:**

- **Rice Paper**: Double wrap each roll to prevent bursting during frying
- **Wheat Wrappers**: Seal edges with water or cornstarch slurry
- Keep unused wrappers covered with damp towel to prevent drying

**Variations:**

- **Wonton Wrappers**: Use square wonton wrappers for smaller, crispier rolls
- **Egg Roll Wrappers**: Larger option for heartier portions

### Blistered Vegetables

- 1 lb fresh green beans, trimmed
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (avocado or vegetable)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- [Optional] 1 tsp sesame seeds
- [Optional] 0.5 tsp red pepper flakes

**Prep Notes:**

- Pat vegetables completely dry for best blistering
- Don't overcrowd the pan - cook in batches if needed

**Variations:**

- **Snap Peas**: Replace green beans with sugar snap peas or snow peas
- **Bok Choy**: Quarter baby bok choy and blister cut-side down
- **Broccolini**: Use broccolini instead of green beans
- **Asian Eggplant**: Add sliced Japanese eggplant to the mix

### For Serving

- Sweet chili sauce
- Soy sauce or ponzu
- Sriracha mayo
- [Optional] Fresh cilantro or Thai basil
- [Optional] Lime wedges

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Filling**:
   - In a bowl, combine ground pork, scallions, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil
   - Mix with hands or fork until well combined
   - If using vegetables, fold them in now

2. **Assemble Spring Rolls**:
   - **For Rice Paper**: Dip wrapper in warm water for 5-10 seconds until pliable. Lay flat on cutting board. Add a second wrapper for double wrapping.
   - **For Wheat Wrappers**: Lay wrapper flat with one corner pointing toward you (diamond shape)
   - Place 2-3 tbsp filling in center, shaped into a log
   - Fold bottom corner over filling, fold in sides, then roll tightly like a burrito
   - Seal edge with water or cornstarch slurry
   - Place seam-side down on a plate
   - Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers

3. **Pan-Fry Spring Rolls**:
   - Heat 2-3 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
   - Working in batches to avoid crowding, place rolls seam-side down
   - Fry 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy, turning to cook all sides
   - Internal temperature should reach 160°F for pork
   - Transfer to wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain

4. **Cook Blistered Vegetables**:
   - In the same skillet (drain most of the oil, leaving about 1 tbsp), increase heat to high
   - Add green beans and whole cherry tomatoes
   - Let sit without stirring for 1-2 minutes to char
   - Toss and cook another 2-3 minutes until beans are charred and tomatoes begin to burst
   - Drizzle with soy sauce, toss, and remove from heat

5. **Serve**: Arrange spring rolls and vegetables on plates. Serve with dipping sauces.

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Baked**: Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush assembled rolls with oil. Bake on parchment-lined sheet for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and crispy. Spray or brush with more oil halfway through for extra crispiness.

**Air Fryer**: Brush rolls with oil. Air fry at 375°F for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and cooked through.

**Deep Fried**: Heat 2-3 inches of oil to 350°F in a deep pot. Fry rolls 4-5 minutes until deep golden brown. Drain on wire rack.

## Notes

- Spring rolls are best eaten immediately for maximum crispiness
- Uncooked assembled rolls can be frozen on a sheet pan, then transferred to freezer bags for up to 2 months (fry from frozen, adding 2-3 minutes to cook time)
- The vegetable side can be made while the rolls drain on the rack
- Don't skip drying the vegetables - moisture prevents proper blistering
