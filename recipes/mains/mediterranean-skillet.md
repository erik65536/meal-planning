# Mediterranean Skillet

A vibrant, one-pan meal featuring seared protein simmered in a tomato-olive sauce.

## Ingredients

### Protein (Choose One)
- 1 lb Chicken Thighs or Breasts (boneless, skinless)
- 1 lb White Fish (Cod, Halibut, or Tilapia)
- 1 can (15 oz) Chickpeas, drained and rinsed

### Vegetables & Aromatics
- 1 pint Cherry Tomatoes, halved
- 1 can (14 oz) Artichoke hearts, quartered and drained
- 0.5 cup Kalamata olives, pitted
- 1 Zucchini, sliced into half-moons
- 2 cups Spinach or Arugula
- 1 Onion, sliced
- 3 cloves Garlic, minced

### Seasoning & Sauce
- 1 tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 tsp Dried Oregano
- 0.5 tsp Dried Basil
- 0.5 tsp Red Pepper Flakes (optional)
- 0.25 cup Chicken or Vegetable Broth (or white wine)
- Juice of half a Lemon
- [Optional] Feta cheese for crumbling

**Prep Notes:**
- Pat the protein dry before searing to ensure a good crust.
- Prep all veggies before you start cooking, as this moves fast.

**Variations:**
- **Puttanesca Style**: Add capers and anchovy paste for a saltier, punchier flavor.
- **Heartier**: Add diced potatoes or sweet potatoes at the start (will increase cook time).

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sear Protein**:
    -   Season chicken or fish with salt, pepper, and oregano.
    -   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
    -   Sear protein for 3-4 mins per side (until golden). Remove and set aside (it doesn't need to be fully cooked yet).
    -   *If using Chickpeas*: Skip searing, just add them in step 3.
2.  **Sauté Veggies**:
    -   Add onion and zucchini to the pan. Sauté 4-5 mins until softening.
    -   Add garlic and cook 30 seconds.
3.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add cherry tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and broth/wine.
    -   Scrape bottom of pan. Let simmer 2-3 mins until tomatoes start to burst.
    -   Nestle the protein (or add chickpeas) back into the sauce.
    -   Cover and simmer on low until protein is cooked through (5-10 mins depending on thickness).
4.  **Finish**:
    -   Remove lid. Stir in spinach until wilted.
    -   Squeeze fresh lemon juice over everything.
    -   Top with fresh herbs or feta if desired.

## Notes
- **Nutrient Boost**: Cooked tomatoes provide lycopene. Olives and olive oil provide healthy monounsaturated fats.
- **Serving**: Great on its own, or served with a side of quinoa or roasted cauliflower.
