# Frittata

An Italian open-faced omelet that finishes in the oven. The perfect vehicle for leftover veggies.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 8-10 large eggs
- 0.5 cup milk or plain Greek yogurt (for tang/creaminess)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp pepper
- 0.5 cup cheese, grated (Cheddar, Goat Cheese, Feta, or Parmesan)

### Mix-ins (Choose 2-3 cups total)

- **Greens**: Spinach, Kale, Chard (wilted)
- **Veggies**: Bell peppers, Onions, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Broccoli, Asparagus (sautéed)
- **Proteins**: Ham, Bacon, Sausage, Smoked Salmon
- **Herbs**: Basil, Parsley, Chives, Dill

### Flavor Combos

- **Greek**: Spinach + Feta + Dill + Red Onion
- **Caprese**: Cherry Tomatoes + Mozzarella + Basil
- **Farmhouse**: Ham + Cheddar + Broccoli
- **Southwest**: Black beans + Corn + Pepper Jack + Cilantro

**Prep Notes:**

- **Crucial Step**: You must cook the vegetables *before* adding the eggs. Raw veggies release water and make the frittata soggy.
- Use an oven-safe skillet (cast iron or stainless steel).

**Variations:**

- **Mini Frittatas**: Bake in a muffin tin at 350°F for 15-20 minutes. Perfect for meal prep.
- **Egg White**: Use liquid egg whites or a mix of whole eggs/whites to lower cholesterol.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Oven to 400°F (200°C).
2.  **Prep Base**: Whisk eggs, milk/yogurt, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir in half the cheese.
3.  **Cook Fillings**:
    -   Heat oil/butter in the oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
    -   Sauté your chosen veggies/meat until tender and moisture has evaporated.
4.  **Assemble**:
    -   Pour egg mixture over the veggies in the pan. Do not stir too much, just distribute evenly.
    -   Sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
    -   Cook on stovetop for 1-2 minutes until edges start to set.
5.  **Bake**:
    -   Transfer skillet to oven.
    -   Bake 10-15 minutes until center is set (jiggles slightly but isn't liquid).
6.  **Serve**: Slice into wedges. Good hot or at room temperature.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Using Greek yogurt increases protein. Load up on the veggies to make this a complete meal.
