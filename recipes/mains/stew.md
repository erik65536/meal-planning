# Stew (Beef or Chicken)

A classic, thick, and hearty stew that warms you from the inside out.

## Ingredients

### Protein

- 1.5 lb Beef Chuck Roast (cubed) OR Chicken Thighs (whole or cubed)
- Salt & Pepper
- 2 tbsp flour (for coating)
- 2 tbsp avocado oil

### Veggies

- 1 onion, chopped large
- 3 carrots, cut into chunks
- 3 celery stalks, cut into chunks
- 1 lb potatoes (Yukon Gold or Red), cubed
- [Optional] 1 cup frozen peas (added at end)
- [Optional] 1 cup butternut squash, cubed
- [Optional] 8 oz mushrooms, halved

### Liquid & Aromatics

- 4 cups broth (Beef or Chicken)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut veggies into large chunks so they don't turn to mush during the long cook time.
- Coat the meat in flour before searing to help thicken the stew later.

**Variations:**

- **Guinness Stew**: Replace 1 cup of broth with dark stout beer.
- **Slow Cooker**: Sear meat first, then dump everything in slow cooker. Cook Low 7-8 hours or High 3-4 hours.
- **Instant Pot**: Sear meat, add rest. Pressure cook High for 35 mins (beef) or 10 mins (chicken). Natural release.

## Cooking Instructions

1.  **Sear Meat**:
    -   Toss meat with flour, salt, and pepper.
    -   Heat oil in a large heavy pot (Dutch oven).
    -   Brown meat on all sides (work in batches). Remove and set aside.
2.  **Sauté Veggies**:
    -   Add onion, carrots, and celery to pot. Cook 3-4 minutes.
    -   Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Cook 1 minute.
3.  **Simmer**:
    -   Add broth, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan.
    -   Return meat to pot. Add potatoes/squash, Worcestershire, thyme, and bay leaf.
    -   Bring to boil, then reduce to very low simmer.
    -   Cover and cook until meat is fork-tender:
        -   **Beef**: 1.5 to 2 hours.
        -   **Chicken**: 45 to 60 minutes.
4.  **Finish**:
    -   Remove bay leaf.
    -   Stir in peas (if using) and cook 5 mins.
    -   Taste and add salt/pepper.
    -   If too thin, mix 1 tbsp cornstarch with water and stir in; boil 1 minute to thicken.

## Notes

- **Nutrient Boost**: Using bone broth increases protein and collagen content. Root vegetables provide sustained energy.
