# Shepherd's Pie

A hearty, comforting casserole with savory meat filling topped with creamy mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients

### Mashed Topping

- 1.5 lb russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1-3 tbsp butter
- 0.25 cup milk
- 0.25-0.5 tsp pepper
- [Optional] 0.25 cup cheese, grated (parmesan, cheddar, etc.)
- [Optional] 0.5 tsp salt
- [Optional] 1 egg (for golden browning)
- [Optional] Cheese topping (for finishing)

**Prep Notes:**

- Cut potatoes into evenly sized pieces (1-2 inch cubes) for consistent cooking
- For smoother mash, use a ricer or food mill
- Don't over-mix or potatoes will become gummy

**Variations:**

- **Sweet Potato Topping**: Replace russet potatoes with sweet potatoes for a sweeter, more nutritious option
- **Cauliflower Mash**: Use mashed cauliflower or half cauliflower, half potatoes for a low-carb alternative
- **Butternut Squash**: Use mashed butternut squash for a slightly sweeter variation
- **Herbed Mash**: Add 1-2 tbsp fresh herbs (chives, parsley, or thyme) to the mash
- **Garlic Mash**: Add 2-3 cloves roasted garlic to the potatoes

### Filling

- 1 tbsp olive oil (or butter)
- 1 lb protein, cooked
- 1 onion, diced
- 2-4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2-3 carrots, sliced or diced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 2 tbsp flour (for thickening)
- [Optional] 0.25-0.5 cup red wine
- 1 cup broth (beef or vegetable)
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dried thyme (or 2 tsp fresh)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 2 tsp fresh)
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- [Optional] 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25-0.5 tsp pepper
- 1 cup frozen peas
- [Optional] 1-2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with water (for extra thickening)

**Prep Notes:**

- Pre-cooked protein and brown it first
- Vegetables should be diced small (1/4 to 1/2 inch) for even cooking

**Variations:**

- **Protein Options**: Ground Lamb (traditional Shepherd's Pie), Ground Beef (technically "Cottage Pie"), Ground Turkey, Ground Chicken, Cubed Lamb or Beef, Lentils or mixed beans (vegetarian), or plant-based ground meat
- **Veggie Add-ins**: Corn, green beans, mushrooms, parsnips, turnips, diced bell peppers, or leeks (instead of onion)
- **Gravy Style**: For thicker gravy, increase flour to 3 tbsp; for thinner, reduce to 1 tbsp

## Seasoning Variations

### Traditional Herb Blend

- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 1 bay leaf

### Savory Umami Blend

- Add 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- Add 1 tsp smoked paprika
- Use beef broth instead of vegetable broth

### Irish Style

- Add 1 tbsp fresh parsley
- Use Guinness beer instead of red wine
- Add extra Worcestershire sauce

### French-Inspired (Hachis Parmentier)

- Add 1 tsp herbes de Provence
- Use white wine instead of red

### Mediterranean Style

- Add 1 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp cumin
- Use diced tomatoes (14 oz can) instead of broth
- Add olives and sun-dried tomatoes

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare Topping**: Boil potatoes in salted water until tender (15-20 minutes). Drain, then mash with add-ins.

2. **Make Filling**:

   - If using raw ground meat: Brown in skillet over medium-high heat, breaking up with a spoon (5-7 minutes). Drain excess fat. Remove and set aside.
   - Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat
   - Saute onion until softened (5 minutes)
   - Add garlic and cook 1 minute
   - Add tomato paste and cook 2 minutes
   - Add carrots and celery, cook 5 minutes
   - Add cooked protein, salt, and pepper
   - Sprinkle flour over mixture and stir to coat
   - Add wine (if using) and cook until reduced by half
   - Add broth, Worcestershire, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf
   - Simmer 10-15 minutes until thickened
   - Stir in peas (and cornstarch slurry if needed)
   - Remove bay leaf

3. **Assemble**:

   - Preheat oven to 400°F or 375°F for convection
   - Transfer filling to a 9x13 inch baking dish
   - Spread mashed potato topping evenly over filling
   - Optional: Brush with beaten egg or dot with butter
   - Optional: Sprinkle with shredded cheese

4. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling. Broil for 2-3 minutes for extra browning if desired.

5. **Rest**: Let stand 10 minutes before serving for easier slicing and serving.

## Topping Ideas

- **Cheese**: Sharp cheddar, gruyere, or parmesan sprinkled on top before baking
- **Herbed Breadcrumbs**: Mix panko with melted butter and herbs, sprinkle over potatoes
- **Crispy Onions**: Top with fried onions during last 10 minutes of baking

## Alternative Cooking Methods

**Individual Ramekins**: Divide filling and topping among 4-6 oven-safe ramekins. Bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes (great for meal prep or portion control).

## Notes

- For best results, use day-old mashed potatoes (drier texture spreads better)
- If filling is too thin, simmer longer or add cornstarch slurry
- If topping browns too quickly, tent with foil
